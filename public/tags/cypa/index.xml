&lt;p>Association of liver calcitriol (active vitamin D metabolite) catabolism with osteomalacia during prolonged use of certain drugs was reported in several recent studies. To examine whether the increased calcitriol catabolism could be a potential link between ageing/diabetes mellitus (DM) and bone loss, we studied the dynamic of expression of CYP24, the main calcitriol catabolising enzyme in the liver of rats during ageing and a long-term experimental DM1. DM1 model was induced with intraperitoneally injected streptozotocin (STZ) (55 mg/kg). Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed 6 and 12 months after the DM1 induction. The immunohistochemical analyses of CYP24 and transforming growth factor ß 1 (TGF-ß1) expression in the liver were performed. We found that ageing and long-term DM1 resulted in a significantly increased expression of CYP24 in hepatocytes, as well as in non-hepatocyte liver cells (Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells). Ageing and long-term DM1 resulted in an increased expression of TGF-ß1 as well. Expression of CYP24 coexisted with the expression of TGF-ß1 in all types of hepatic cells.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dark-skinned hunter-gatherers may generate 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily</title><link>/posts/dark-skinned-hunter-gatherers-may-generate-2000-iu-of-vitamin-d-daily.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dark-skinned-hunter-gatherers-may-generate-2000-iu-of-vitamin-d-daily.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="optimal-vitamin-d3-daily-intake-of-2000-iu-inferred-from-modeled-solar-exposure-of-ancestral-humans-in-northern-tanzania">Optimal vitamin D3 daily intake of 2000 IU inferred from modeled solar exposure of ancestral humans in Northern Tanzania&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>The purpose of this review is to examine vitamin D in the context of sport nutrition and its potential role in optimizing athletic performance. Vitamin D receptors (VDR) and vitamin D response elements (VDREs) are located in almost every tissue within the human body including skeletal muscle. The hormonally-active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, has been shown to play critical roles in the human body and regulates over 900 gene variants. Based on the literature presented, it is plausible that vitamin D levels above the normal reference range (up to 100 nmol/L) might increase skeletal muscle function, decrease recovery time from training, increase both force and power production, and increase testosterone production, each of which could potentiate athletic performance. Therefore, maintaining higher levels of vitamin D could prove beneficial for athletic performance. Despite this situation, large portions of athletic populations are vitamin D deficient. Currently, the research is inconclusive with regards to the optimal intake of vitamin D, the specific forms of vitamin D one should ingest, and the distinct nutrient-nutrient interactions of vitamin D with vitamin K that affect arterial calcification and hypervitaminosis. Furthermore, it is possible that dosages exceeding the recommendations for vitamin D (i.e. dosages up to 4000-5000 IU/day), in combination with 50 to 1000 mcg/day of vitamin K1 and K2 could aid athletic performance. This review will investigate these topics, and specifically their relevance to athletic performance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lung cancer – reduced deaths if have a good vitamin D gene (CYP27B1)</title><link>/posts/lung-cancer-reduced-deaths-if-have-a-good-vitamin-d-gene-cyp27b1.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/lung-cancer-reduced-deaths-if-have-a-good-vitamin-d-gene-cyp27b1.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="genetic-polymorphisms-in-the-vitamin-d-pathway-in-relation-to-lung-cancer-risk-and-survival">Genetic polymorphisms in the vitamin D pathway in relation to lung cancer risk and survival.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Abstract: The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is the nutrient intake considered to be sufficient to meet the requirements of 97.5% of the population. Recent reports revealed a statistical error in the calculation of the RDA for vitamin D opening the question of what the recommendation should be. We took a dual approach to answer this question: (1) we aggregated &lt;strong>108 published estimates&lt;/strong> on vitamin D supplementation and vitamin D status; and (2) we analyzed &lt;strong>13,987 observations of program participants&lt;/strong> . The aggregation of published data revealed that&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CYP2R1 and GC variations decrease vitamin D response – PHD thesis</title><link>/posts/cyp2r1-and-gc-variations-decrease-vitamin-d-response-phd-thesis.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cyp2r1-and-gc-variations-decrease-vitamin-d-response-phd-thesis.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="common-genetic-variations-in-the-cyp2r1-and-gc-genes-are-determinants-of-vitamin-d-status-in-danes">Common genetic variations in the CYP2R1 and GC genes are determinants of vitamin D status in Danes&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Vitamin D is considered a key fat-soluble vitamin critically important for good bone- and overall health throughout life. Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis, and moreover increases the risk of various non-skeletal adverse health outcomes including cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, some cancers and overall mortality. In humans, vitamin D is mainly synthesized in the skin after solar exposure and only a small amount is obtained through the diet. An inter-individual variation in vitamin D status exists, which may be explained by genetic variation in vitamin D modulating genes. Twin and family-based studies indicate that genetic variation may have an appreciable influence on vitamin D status. Moreover, several candidate gene studies including two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP2R1, CYP24A1, CYP27B1, C10orf88, DHCR7/NADSYN1, GC and VDR genes to be associated with vitamin D status. The main hypothesis of this work was that genetically determined variation in vitamin D metabolism would influence the effect of vitamin D sources (vitamin D-supplementation and ultraviolet (UV)-B) on vitamin D status. This was done by assessing the association between 25 SNPs located in the CYP2R1, CYP24A1, CYP27B1, C10orf88, DHCR7/NADSYN1, GC and VDR genes and vitamin D status in &lt;strong>756 participants&lt;/strong> in the VitmaD study in late summer (paper I), at the end of a winter season (paper II), after 6 months intake of vitamin D3-fortified bread and milk (paper II) and in 92 participants in the VitDgen study after artificial UVB irradiation during winter (paper III). Common genetic variations in the CYP2R1 and GC genes were found to be important determinants of vitamin D status in three out of four scenarios:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D papers from European Vitamin D Association Conference</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-papers-from-european-vitamin-d-association-conference.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-papers-from-european-vitamin-d-association-conference.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Most of the ENGLISH presentations of the conference follow&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Vitamin D has garnered a great deal of attention in recent years due to a global prevalence of vitamin D deficiency associated with an increased risk of a variety of human diseases. Specifically, hypovitaminosis D in pregnant women is highly common and has important implications for the mother and lifelong health of the child, since it has been linked to maternal and child infections, small-for-gestational age, preterm delivery, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, as well as imprinting on the infant for life chronic diseases. Therefore, factors that regulate vitamin D metabolism are of main importance, especially during pregnancy. The hormonal form and most active metabolite of vitamin D is calcitriol. This hormone mediates its biological effects through a specific nuclear receptor, which is found in many tissues including the placenta. Calcitriol synthesis and degradation depend on the expression and activity of CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 cytochromes, respectively, for which regulation is tissue specific. Among the factors that modify these cytochromes expression and/or activity are calcitriol itself, parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23, cytokines, calcium and phosphate. This review provides a current overview on the regulation of vitamin D metabolism, focusing on vitamin D deficiency during gestation and its impact on pregnancy outcomes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blacks have lower vitamin D levels, but OK active vitamin D levels (VDBP)</title><link>/posts/blacks-have-lower-vitamin-d-levels-but-ok-active-vitamin-d-levels-vdbp.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/blacks-have-lower-vitamin-d-levels-but-ok-active-vitamin-d-levels-vdbp.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="showhide_heading" id="See_also_VitaminDWiki">

&lt;p>The main aim of the study was to determine the influence of genetic factors on the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D response to vitamin D supplementation. The main outcome measure was an increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D after vitamin D supplementation. The patients are part of a randomized controlled trial in individuals with prediabetes assigned to 20 000 IU of vitamin D3 per week or placebo for 12 months. A total of 484 subjects were included in the analyses and genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms in the &lt;strong>DBP, DHCR7, CYP2R1, and CYP24A1&lt;/strong> genes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms from all 4 selected genes were significantly related to baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations with differences between major and minor homozygote genotypes ranging from 4.4 to 19.2 nmol/l. In the subjects given vitamin D, those with genotypes with the highest baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration also had the highest 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration after 12 months, and the increase (delta) in 25-hydroxyvitamin D was significantly related to 3 of the single nucleotide polymorphisms. The increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was also higher in lean vs. obese subjects, and higher in those with low baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Continuing Medical Education (CME) for Vitamin D includes genes and questions</title><link>/posts/continuing-medical-education-cme-for-vitamin-d-includes-genes-and-questions.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/continuing-medical-education-cme-for-vitamin-d-includes-genes-and-questions.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of a wide range of adverse health outcomes. The active form of vitamin D has an important role in calcium metabolism and in bone mineralisation, but the evidence for other health outcomes is mixed, with the strongest effects seen in the weakest epidemiological study designs. There are plausible pathways whereby vitamin D deficiency can impair immune function, resulting in both overactivity and increased risk of autoimmune disease, as well as immune suppression with poorer resistance to infection. Vitamin D status may influence the bacterial flora that constitute the microbiome and affect immune function through this route. Exposure of the skin to ultraviolet radiation causes the production of a range of chemicals, including vitamin D, and new research is exploring possible vitamin D-independent immunomodulatory pathways.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>One autoimmune disease lowers vitamin D, a second AI disease does not lower it further</title><link>/posts/one-autoimmune-disease-lowers-vitamin-d-a-second-ai-disease-does-not-lower-it-further.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/one-autoimmune-disease-lowers-vitamin-d-a-second-ai-disease-does-not-lower-it-further.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-and-autoimmunity-what-happens-in-autoimmune-polyendocrine-syndromes">Vitamin D and autoimmunity: what happens in autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes?&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>There is no doubt that vitamin D plays a crucial role in the maintenance of musculoskeletal system. But the function of this ancient molecule presumably ranges far beyond hormone-like regulation, as it could be generated by simple unicellular organisms. First, we are going to discuss the role of vitamin D as a global regulator of homeostasis from a historical perspective, but later we will focus on current views and its relevance to human physiology and pathology. Three milestones are defining the impact of vitamin D on science and humanity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quantifying the vitamin D economy in the body - Heaney</title><link>/posts/quantifying-the-vitamin-d-economy-in-the-body-heaney.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/quantifying-the-vitamin-d-economy-in-the-body-heaney.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Figure 1&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The sunshine vitamin has been associated with reduced risk for many chronic illnesses including cancer and cancer mortality. Epidemiologic and ecological studies have suggested that living at higher latitudes and having lower blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are associated with increased risk for up to 15 cancers including breast, colon, lung, lymphoma, pancreatic, ovarian and prostate cancer. Most randomized controlled trials using appropriate doses of vitamin D have suggested that improvement in vitamin D status reduces risk for several cancers. Although the exact mechanism by which enhanced vitamin D status reduces risk for cancer is not completely understood, there is evidence that by raising blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D this metabolite can enter a wide variety of cells in the body and then be converted to 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3. The vitamin D metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, has been demonstrated to markedly reduce cellular proliferation especially of malignant cells that have a vitamin D receptor. It also induces terminal differentiation. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is also anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic which also plays a role in reducing the growth and spread of malignant cells. Thus improvement in vitamin D status with sensible sun exposure, vitamin D supplementation and ingesting foods containing vitamin D is a reasonable strategy to reduce risk of malignancy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Inflammation, infection, active vitamin D, and Olmesartan</title><link>/posts/inflammation-infection-active-vitamin-d-and-olmesartan.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/inflammation-infection-active-vitamin-d-and-olmesartan.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Author asked that their paper be removed from VitaminDWiki&lt;/p>

Introduction
Inflammation is believed to be a contributing factor to many chronic diseases. The influence of vitamin D deficiency on inflammation is being explored but studies have not demonstrated a causative effect.
Methods
Low serum 25(OH)D is also found in healthy persons exposed to adequate sunlight. Despite increased vitamin D supplementation inflammatory diseases are increasing. The current method of determining vitamin D status may be at fault. The level of 25(OH)D does not always reflect the level of 1,25(OH)2D. Assessment of both metabolites often reveals elevated 1,25(OH)2D, indicating abnormal vitamin D endocrine function.
Findings
This article reviews vitamin D's influence on the immune system, examines the myths regarding vitamin D photosynthesis, discusses ways to accurately assess vitamin D status, describes the risks of supplementation, explains the effect of persistent infection on vitamin D metabolism and presents a novel immunotherapy which provides evidence of an infection connection to inflammation.
Conclusion
Some authorities now believe that low 25(OH)D is a consequence of chronic inflammation rather than the cause. Research points to a bacterial etiology pathogenesis for an inflammatory disease process which results in high 1,25(OH)2D and low 25(OH)D. Immunotherapy, directed at eradicating persistent intracellular pathogens, corrects dysregulated vitamin D metabolism and resolves inflammatory symptoms.

!!!!Introduction
Inflammation is involved in many chronic diseases and concern has been raised about the influence of vitamin D deficiency on inflammatory processes. When studies found an association between inflammatory diseases and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), further research found evidence of low vitamin D in a large segment of the general population. This led some authorities to declare a world-wide epidemic of vitamin D deficiency and to recommend vitamin D supplementation. Experts are debating the definition of vitamin D deficiency and the appropriate vitamin D doses, while further research is being done to determine if vitamin D supplementation has the intended effect.
According to some current definitions of vitamin D deficiency, even healthy persons, exposed to adequate sunlight, are unable to acquire enough vitamin D without supplementation. Often reiterated causes of vitamin D deficiency can be disputed in the light of more current research. In the absence of definitive studies, authorities are questioning the wisdom of supplementing the general population with vitamin D. The definition of Vitamin D deficiency needs re-evaluation in view of the fact that low 25(OH)D is found in both healthy and sick individuals. Concerns about vitamin D deficiency merit a closer look at the current method of determining vitamin D status because the level of 25(OH)D does not always reflect the level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D (1,25(OH)2D). Analysis of this active metabolite may reveal elevated 1,25(OH)2D) in the presence of low 25(OH)D and lead to a diagnosis of abnormal vitamin D endocrine system function.
An infectious pathogenesis posits that intracellular bacteria disrupt the vitamin D regulated immune system, resulting in persistent infection and chronic inflammation.
In the clinical setting, a novel immunotherapy is demonstrating the ability to resolve vitamin D metabolism dysfunction, restore immune function, and thus, eliminate infection and reduce inflammation. This review ponders the question, ‘‘Is low 25(OH)D a cause of, or a consequence of inflammation?” The answer is found in the evidence that adds persistent intracellular infection to the equation.
!!!!Vitamin D metabolism
The sequential metabolic processes that convert biologically inactive, parental vitamin D into active metabolites begin when vitamin D3 is photosynthesized in the skin or when vitamin D2 or D3 is ingested. Vitamin D is transported to the liver where it is hydroxylated by an enzyme (CYP2R1, also known as cytochrome P450 2R1) to produce 25(OH)D [1]. 25(OH)D is then transported to the kidneys where it is hydroxylated by another enzyme (CYP27B1, formerly 1a-hydroxylase) to produce 1,25(OH)2D. 1,25(OH)2D (also known as calcitriol), the active metabolite, is the most potent steroid hormone in the human body [2]. Feedback mechanisms regulate production of 1,25(OH)2D in the kidneys via serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), fibroblast-like growth factor- 23 (FGF23) calcium, and phosphate [3]. 1,25(OH)2D is also produced in many other tissues (e.g., skin, macrophages, colon, pancreas, blood vessels, etc.) by enzymatic actions [4]. The vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) transports 1,25(OH)2D to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the cell nucleus [5]. The VDR is a member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-regulated transcription factors. 1,25(OH)2D binds to the VDR and mediates the transcription of DNA, triggered by signaling proteins, like nuclear factor kappa-B (NFk-B) [6] (Fig. 1).
The influence of 1,25(OH)2D on the immune system is one of its most important roles. 1,25(OH)2D regulates the immune system via the VDR which is present in most immune cell types, particularly in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells [7]. 1,25(OH)2D activates the VDR to express antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as cathelicidin and beta defensins which attack pathogens [8, 9]. In general, the innate immune system is enhanced and the adaptive immune system is inhibited by 1,25(OH)2D [10, 11]. Thus, an effective immune response is heavily dependent on the vitamin D endocrine system which performs a balancing act of inflammation versus anti-inflammation.
!!!!Vitamin D deficiency
Concerns about vitamin D deficiency arose when studies showed patients with autoimmune diseases have lower levels of serum 25(OH)D and study subjects given vitamin D had lower rates of autoimmune diseases and fewer markers of inflammation [12, 13]. However, authorities have not agreed on the significance of low 25(OH)D and without a consistent normal range for serum 25(OH)D, the definitions of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency from the Vitamin D Council, the Endocrine Society and the Institute of Medicine vary significantly.
__The Vitamin D Council definition [14]:__
Deficient: 0-40 ng/ml
Sufficient: 40-80 ng/ml
High normal: 80-100 ng/ml
__The Endocrine Society definition [15]:__
Deficiency &lt; 20 ng/ml
Insufficiency = 20-29 ng/ml
__The Institute of Medicine definition [16]:__
Risk/deficiency &lt;12 ng/ml
Risk/insufficiency = 12-20 ng/ml
Sufficient = 20 ng/ml
In 2006, the Merck Manual listed 25-40 ng/ml as the normal 25(OH)D range [17]. Recently, this range has skyrocketed to 30-74 ng/ml [18]. Quest Diagnostics now lists the upper limit of normal 25(OH)D as 100 ng/ml [19]. Laboratory reference ranges for serum 25(OH)D levels have long been based upon average values from populations of healthy individuals but many people are now supplementing with vitamin D. In the US, the leading authority regarding medical research is the prestigious Institute of Medicine (IOM). The 2010 IOM report on vitamin D emphasized that the current measurements, or cut-off points, of sufficiency and deficiency of 25(OH) D in use by laboratories have not been set using rigorous scientific studies. It suggests that since no central authority has determined which cut-off points to use, reports of deficiency and lab ranges may be skewed and numbers overestimated [16]. Therefore, it would be prudent to use the IOM vitamin D deficiency guideline in the clinical setting, for clinical studies and when evaluating research results.
!!!!Purported reasons for vitamin D deficiency
Is low 25(OH)D among the general population an accurate assessment of vitamin D deficiency? Many reasons are cited for the current ‘epidemic’ of vitamin D ‘deficiency’ but closer examination reveals these beliefs are based on outdated or limited studies and can be challenged with more recent research.
Melanin pigmentation is only one factor that determines the amount of vitamin D3 which is photosynthesized [20, 21]. Bogh et al. [22] measured the baseline serum 25(OH)D and total cholesterol levels of 182 fair-skinned and dark-skinned subjects; and studied the effect of UV radiation on their serum 25(OH)D levels. They found the amount of serum 25(OH)D produced was determined by the amount of cholesterol in the skin, not on skin pigmentation. Matsuoka et al. [23] investigated the effect of racial pigmentation on vitamin D3 formation, simulating the process with a fixed dose of UVB radiation and concluded that while racial pigmentation has a photoprotective effect, it does not prevent the generation of normal levels of active vitamin D metabolites. Persons with dark skin also compensate for low 25(OH)D by rapidly converting it to the active 1,25(OH)2D metabolite, thus allowing them to maintain adequate vitamin D status [24]. Skin pigmentation does not appear to negatively affect vitamin D status [25].
Clothing is a barrier to vitamin D photosynthesis but this is an issue only for people who cover themselves from head to toe [26]. It takes relatively little sunlight exposure to acquire adequate stores of vitamin D and few people wear enough clothes to prevent that from happening. Ten to 15 min of sunlight or daylight exposure to a small area of skin (e.g., the forearm or face, etc.) twice a week, without sunscreen, supplies all the vitamin D necessary for health [27]. The belief that sunscreen lotion blocks vitamin D production is based on a 1987 study done by Matsuoka et al. [28] that was funded by the ultraviolet foundation, which is supported by the tanning bed industry. Contradictory information was provided by Diehl and Chiu [29] which concluded that although sunscreens are effective, many may not actually be blocking UV-B because they are improperly or inadequately applied [30]. Thus, sunscreen use may not actually diminish vitamin D synthesis in real world use. However, prolonged unprotected sun exposure should be avoided to reduce the risk of developing skin cancer.
Although pollution can block some ultraviolet radiation, even in urban areas of high pollution 50 % of UV rays reach the ground [31]. A significant amount of UV radiation exposure can be obtained in dense metropolitan areas; tall buildings provide shade but shade gives up to 50 % of UV rays. Indoor workers receive 10-20 % of outdoor workers’ yearly UV exposure [31]; and for many, this may be adequate, especially if sunlight exposure is higher when they are not working. UV radiation is reflected or scattered to varying extents by different surfaces. The scattering and absorption of light by clouds may not significantly reduce natural light exposure because over 90 % of UV rays may penetrate clouds [31]. Environmental factors are rarely an impediment to photosynthesis of adequate vitamin D.
As the skin ages, there is a decline in the cutaneous levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol, resulting in a marked reduction of the skin’s capacity to produce vitamin D3 [32].
However, despite the up to fourfold reduction in vitamin D3 production in a 70-year-old compared to a 20-year-old, the skin has such a high capacity to make vitamin D3 that elders exposed to sunlight will produce an adequate amount of vitamin D3 to satisfy their vitamin D requirement [33, 34].
A 1988 study by Webb et al. [35] is often cited to support the conviction that latitude dramatically influences the amount of solar radiation available to synthesize vitamin D3. However, other researchers who conducted more recent studies refute this hypothesis. Kimlin et al. [36] report, ‘‘It may no longer be correct to assume that vitamin D levels in populations follow latitude gradients’’. And Lubin [37] states, ‘‘Geophysical surveys have shown that UV-B penetration over 24 h, during the summer months at Canadian north latitudes when there are many hours of sunlight, equals or exceeds UV-B penetration at the equator.’’ Ross et al. [16] report that ample opportunities exist to form vitamin D (and store it in the liver and fat for later use) from exposure to sunlight during the spring, summer, and fall months even in the far north latitudes.
Acceptance of these vitamin D myths regarding photosynthesis prevents consideration of the alternate hypothesis—low serum 25(OH)D, despite adequate photosynthesis of vitamin D3, is a result of an inflammatory process.
!!!!Low vitamin D is found in healthy subjects
Many studies of healthy subjects have found levels of 25(OH)D that, by some vitamin D definitions, are declared deficient (hypovitaminosis-D) [38, 39]. Vitamin D levels that are considered deficient have even been found in persons who are exposed to abundant sunlight [40]. Binkley et al. [41] showed a mean 25(OH)D level of 31.6 ng/ml among healthy young adult Hawaiian surfers. It is clear that low levels of 25(OH)D are found in both healthy persons and those with autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases. Opposing reasoning can be used to explain this contradiction. One explanation reasons that healthy persons with low 25(OH)D will become sick and sick people will develop lower 25(OH)D levels (Fig. 2); however, studies do not support this hypothesis. The correct explanation may be that, in the absence of disease, low 25(OH)D is normal.
!!!!Low vitamin D in the presence of diseases
Since low 25(OH)D is found in both healthy persons and those with autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases, assessing vitamin D status with the measurement of an additional clinical marker may be helpful. It is asserted that D status with measurement of 1,25(OH)2D may be helpful low levels of 25(OH)D accurately reflect vitamin D status; however, measurement of 1,25(OH)2D often demonstrates a positive correlation of elevated 1,25(OH)2D to inflammatory diseases (Fig. 2). This is illustrated by Blaney et al.

Fig. 2 Interpretation of vitamin D deficiency via calcitriol measurement. Since low 25(OH)D is found in both healthy persons and those with autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases, assessing vitamin D status with measurement of 1,25(OH)2D may be helpful

in a study of 100 patients with autoimmune and chronic disease which found that 85 % of subjects had levels of 1,25(OH)2D higher than 46.2 pg/ml without hypercalcemia. Although this serum level may be considered normal by some, lab ranges for 1,25(OH)2D may have been skewed high by the presence of patients with unrecognized persistent intracellular infection and thus, dysregulated vitamin D metabolism. The Danish 1,25(OH)2D population data (from a large and reliable study) found the mean value for 1,25(OH)2D in a normal population was 29 pg/ml with a standard deviation of 9.5
. More frequent measurement of both D-metabolites in the clinical and research settings, may shed light on the true meaning of low 25(OH)D.
Rickets is often cited as proof of the need for vitamin D supplementation. However, a review of the metabolic processes involved provides some prospective. Adequate vitamin D is essential to prevent rickets, but adequate calcium is equally important; if either calcium or vitamin D is deficient, bone health suffers. Hypophosphatemia is the common denominator of all rickets; low calcium intake leads to hyperparathyroidism, which leads to high phosphorus excretion and, thus, phosphorus deficiency [44]. Rickets is rare in the developed world; however, children in developing countries, who usually photosynthesize enough vitamin D from sunlight, develop rickets if poverty prevents them from eating enough calcium-rich food [45, 46]. Studies have found that rickets occurs in sunny countries due to poor calcium intake and is cured with increased calcium ingestion [47, 48].
Osteoporosis is another disease which is closely linked with vitamin D. Adequate vitamin D is an important factor in maintaining bone health to avoid osteoporosis but a study by Reid et al. [49] published in The Lancet found little evidence supporting the use of vitamin D supplements by seniors hoping to improve bone density and ward off potential fractures. 1,25(OH)2D maintains calcium homeostasis between blood, cells and bones by stimulating calcium absorption from the intestines, reabsorption in the kidneys, and resorption in bones [50]. 1,25(OH)2D up- regulates the VDR in the small intestine, which then transcribes genes that shuttle calcium and phosphorus through the intestinal epithelium. However, mucosal response and calcium/phosphorus absorption are dependent on a competent VDR and elevated 1,25(OH)2D reduces VDR competence [51]. Thus, calcium and phosphorus absorption may be inhibited if VDR function is impaired by elevated 1,25(OH)2D. This is illustrated by Abreu et al. [52] in a study of Crohn’s patients with elevated 1,25(OH)2D and low bone mineral density which concluded that treatment of the underlying inflammation would improve metabolic bone disease. In fact, there is ample evidence that elevated 1,25(OH)2D leads to bone loss. Brot et al. [53] found that elevated levels of 1,25(OH)2D were strongly associated with decreased bone mineral density and content, and increased bone turnover. When levels are above 42 pg/ml 1,25(OH)2D stimulates bone osteoclasts. This leads to osteoporosis, dental fractures and calcium deposition into the soft tissues [54]. Vanderschueren et al. [55] found that a combination of high 1,25(OH)2D and low 25(OH)D is associated with the poorest bone health.
!!!!Vitamin D supplementation
It is reasoned that if low 25(OH)D indicates a current or potential disease state, then increasing 25(OH)D by supplementing with vitamin D should provide some symptom relief and/or protection. So far, there is scant evidence for this hypothesis [56, 57]. According to Ross et al. [16] in the 2010 IOM report, ‘‘Outcomes related to autoimmune disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, falls and physical performance, immune functioning, infections, neuropsychological functioning, and preeclampsia could not be linked reliably with calcium or vitamin D intake and were often conflicting.’’ Despite the recent increase in vitamin D supplementation, chronic diseases have increased and are expected to continue increasing [58, 59].
Consequently, more vitamin D experts are beginning to reconsider vitamin D supplementation among the general population [60]. Recommending higher vitamin D intake to large populations carries the potential risk of overdosing certain individuals [61]. It is difficult to ingest too much vitamin D from food, and natural mechanisms regulate the amount of vitamin D3 photosynthesized from sunlight [62].
However, elevated 25(OH)D and hypervitaminosis-D can occur due to vitamin D supplementation [63]. A study by Noordam et al. [65] cast doubt on the causal nature of previously reported associations between low levels of vitamin D and age-related diseases and mortality. A comprehensive review by Autier et al. [65] concluded that low concentrations of 25(OH)D are most likely an effect of health disorders and not a cause of illness. Commenting on the findings in a press statement, Autier et al. [64] advised against vitamin D supplementation and explained the observed discrepancy between observational and randomized trials:
Decreases in vitamin D levels are a marker of deteriorating health. Ageing and inflammatory processes involved in disease occurrence and clinical course reduce vitamin D concentrations, which would explain why vitamin D deficiency is reported in a wide range of disorders. We postulate that inflammation is the common factor between most nonskeletal health disorders and low 25(OH)D concentrations. Inflammatory processes involved in disease occurrence and clinical course would reduce 25(OH)D, which would explain why low vitamin D status is reported in a wide range of disorders. However, increases in 25(OH)D have no effect on inflammatory processes or on disorders at the origin of these processes.
A 2014 meta-analysis by Bolland et al. [66] on the effects of vitamin D supplementation on skeletal, vascular, or cancer outcomes concludes that vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium does not reduce skeletal or non-skeletal outcomes in unselected community-dwelling individuals by more than 15 %. The authors further state that future trials with similar designs are unlikely to alter these conclusions. Because of emerging concerns about elevated 25(OH)D, the IOM has shifted the paradigm from thinking about ‘more is better’ to a more risk-averse approach [67]. It has also challenged the notion that harm should be viewed in terms of vitamin D toxicity such as hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, or metastatic calcification and has advanced the concept of ‘harm’ in terms of chronic disease outcomes and mortality [16]. Because adverse effects of vitamin D supplementation may take decades to be realized, clinicians (mindful of the medical ethics precept ‘‘First, do no harm’’) should err on the side of caution; follow the IOM guideline and wait for the results of longterm vitamin D studies.
!!!!Bacterial pathogenesis of low vitamin D hypothesis
If evidence indicates that most people get adequate vitamin D from sunlight exposure but healthy persons are found to be ‘deficient’ by recent standards, what is the explanation for this phenomenon? Vitamin D proponents use a disease deficiency model to explain low levels of 25(OH)D. Their hypothesis states low 25(OH)D causes chronic diseases; however, a pathogenesis has not been elucidated [68]. Low serum 25(OH)D in the presence of disease can also be explained with a dysregulated vitamin D metabolism model [69]. This hypothesis proposes that low vitamin D is the consequence of a chronic inflammatory process caused by persistent infection. The bacterial pathogenesis theorizes that intracellular (cell wall deficient) bacteria invade nucleated cells, use strategies to avoid destruction and cause abnormal vitamin D endocrine function, resulting in low vitamin D. Excess 1,25(OH)2D is produced in an effort to up-regulate the VDR to transcribe AMPs; and 25(OH)D is rapidly metabolized in the process, resulting in a low serum level. The resulting elevated 1,25(OH)2D causes chronic, systemic inflammation and its accompanying symptoms (Fig. 3).
The existence of bacteria which are capable of invading human cells has been known for over a century and are described by many authors [70, 71]. The lack of a cell wall enables them to enter human cells and proliferate because they fail to elicit an appropriate response when the immune system is compromised. In particular, they enter the macrophages—the very immune cells deployed to kill invading pathogens. The inability of most research labs to culture cell wall deficient (CWD) bacteria has been an obstacle to their acceptance, and reliance on Koch’s postulates has made it difficult to correlate CWD bacteria to specific diseases [72]. But some researchers believe Koch’s postulates may have to be redefined in terms of molecular data when dormant and non-culturable bacteria are implicated as causative agents of mysterious diseases [73]. OConnor et al. [74] (in their article entitled Emerging Infectious Determinants of Chronic Diseases) report, ‘‘microbes can now be irrefutably linked to pathology without meeting Koch’s postulates” and “...powerful tools of molecular biology have exposed new causal links by detecting diffi- cult-to-culture and novel agents in chronic illness settings.’’ Domingue [75] commented, ‘‘This might translate into an etiology for chronic inflammatory diseases, when the stressed bacteria increase in numbers and overwhelm the normal biological functions of the host.’’ Nunez [76] was quoted in the University of Michigan Health System newsletter, ‘‘In our study, the presence of bacterial microbes inside the cell is what triggers the immune response.’’ Rolhion and Darfeuille-Michaud [77] observed that the presence of pathogenic invasive bacteria could be the link between an innate immune response to invasive bacteria and the development of inflammation. A number of studies suggest disease associations with CWD bacteria [78-83]. Verway et al. [79] report ‘‘.data suggest that at least a subset of the genetic predisposition to Crohn’s disease results from defects in the detection and/or processing of intracellular pathogens by the innate immune system.’’ O’Connor et al. [74] state, ‘‘The epidemiologic, clinical, and pathologic features of many chronic inflammatory diseases are consistent with a microbial cause. Infectious agents likely determine more cancers, immune-mediated syndromes, neurodevelopmental disorders, and other chronic conditions than currently appreciated.”
CWD bacteria are considered communicable but not contagious; protective immunity depends on an effective cell-mediated immune response [80]. It is now well appreciated that pathologic processes caused by infectious agents may only emerge clinically after an incubation of decades [81]. Among the speculated causes of the increase in chronic infections are overuse of beta-lactam antibiotics [82, 83] and immunosuppression via excess 25(OH)D production [84] or immunosuppressive medications [85]. Many microbiologists now believe at least some, if not all, of the inflammation which drives the chronic disease process is caused by the presence of these stealthy intracellular pathogens [86]. A considerable body of experimental and clinical evidence supports the concept that difficult-to- culture and dormant bacteria are involved in latency of infection and that these persistent bacteria may be pathogenic [73, 87, 88]. McDougal [89] states, ‘‘Evidence now confirms that non-communicable chronic diseases can stem from infectious agents.’’
!!!!Effects of intracellular pathogens on the immune system
Pathogens gain many advantages by parasitizing immune cells and altering nuclear receptor activity. Tissue invasion provides a privileged niche with access to host protein and iron, sequestration from immune response, and a means for persistence [90]. In the arms race of host-microbe coevolution, successful microbial pathogens have evolved innovative strategies to evade host immune responses. For example, ‘crosstalk manipulation’ undermines host defenses and contributes to microbial adaptive fitness [91, 92]. Pathogenic microbes also induce stress responses which protect the cell from lethal factors, express proteases that degrade AMPs, use biofilms as a shield and modulate host cell motility to facilitate establishment of an infection [93, 94]. Genetic foreign and host protein interactions alter gene transcription and translation mechanisms, and many species survive by horizontal gene transfer [95, 96].
It is theorized that bacteria have developed some of these strategies in order to invade host cells and remain undetected within cellular cytoplasm. Many bacterial pathogens form antibiotic-tolerant persister cells which can replicate within macrophages. In this form they can cause subclinical infection and have been associated with chronic diseases [95, 97, 98]. Intracellular bacteria can modulate cytokine production [99]; and in monocytes and macrophages, cytokine activation markedly inhibits 1,25(OH)2D/ VDR gene transcription [100].
Macrophage microbicidal mechanisms are responsible for the control and elimination of pathogens. 1,25(OH)2D production and action in macrophages activates toll-like receptors to increase expression of the AMP cathelicidin which kills infectious invaders [101, 102]. When the immune system is fighting a persistent microbe, inflammatory molecules are continuously released in an effort to kill the pathogen [103]. Immune defenses stimulate Th17 cells and contribute to the development of chronic inflammatory conditions [104,	105]. An ineffective immunological response causes low-grade inflammation and hagocyte-inflicted tissue damage plays an important role in many chronic diseases [106]; autoimmune patients acquire a distinct pathogenic microbiota and multi-morbidity often results [107, 108]. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that bacteria have evolved strategies which allow them to persist within host cells. The exact mechanisms are unknown and warrant further study.
!!!!The compromised immune system, infection and vitamin D
In an essay on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and immune response, Smith [109] postulated that unresolved cellular stress may be caused by infectious agents to avoid adaptive immune responses. The host immune response has developed many mechanisms to neutralize and remove pathogenic bacteria. In turn, pathogenic bacteria have developed mechanisms to alter and evade the host immune response [110, 111]. Regulation of the VDR is a common mechanism used in the host defense against pathogens but certain microbes have been shown to slow innate immune defenses by down-regulating the VDR:
*Mycobacterium tuberculosis down-regulates VDR activity [112].
*Mycobacterium leprae inhibits VDR activity through down-regulation of CYP27B1 in monocytes [113].
*Aspergillus fumigatus secretes a toxin capable of down-regulating the VDR in macrophages [114].
*Epstein-Barr virus lowers VDR activity [115].
*HIV completely shuts down VDR activity [116].
*In VDR knockout mice, a circumstance that closely mimics extreme VDR dysregulation, 1,25(OH)2D levels increase by a factor of ten [117].
Studies also point to immune system depression and elevated 1,25(OH)2D in chronic diseases [118]:
*Sarcoidosis patients are deficient in cathelicidin despite healthy vitamin D3 levels [119].
*1,25(OH)2D is high (>60 pg/ml) in 42 % of Crohn’s patients and the source of the active vitamin D may be the inflamed intestine [52].
*1,25(OH)2D is elevated in the synovial fluid of patients with RA (rheumatoid arthritis) [120].
*Crohn’s disease decreases expression of cathelicidin [121].
High levels of 1,25(OH)2D may result when down- regulation of the VDR by bacterial ligands prevents the receptor from expressing enzymes necessary to keep 1,25(OH)2D in a normal range [42]. Elevated 1,25(OH)2D further reduces VDR competence, suppresses macrophage function, and blocks the nuclear factor kappa-B pathway; thus inhibiting immune system function [116, 122, 123]. Reducing the ability of the VDR to express elements of innate immune function allows intracellular bacteria to persist in the cytoplasm of nucleated cells and may account for the increased susceptibility to non-bacterial co-infections that are commonly found in patients with chronic illnesses [124, 125]. Theoretically, immune system suppression allows parasitic microbes to persist and proliferate in host phagocytes, successfully compete for nutritional resources, and displace commensal organisms from their niche [126]. Elevated 1,25(OH)2D appears to be evidence of a disabled immune system’s attempt to activate the VDR to combat infection.
!!!!Autoimmune disease
Numerous examples can be found in which pathogens express antigens that cross-react with host antigens or induce local inflammatory responses that can lead to autoimmune responses through a very complex set of circumstances [127]. The prevailing theory regarding the etiology of autoimmune disease states that an overactive immune system produces auto-antibodies against self, but infection as an environmental factor in autoimmunity has long been recognized. An alternate hypothesis posits a bacterial etiology in which a persistent intracellular infection causes a cytokine release that induces signals to T cells and B cells, and the antibodies they produce (to the intracellular invader) include some that attack human proteins, as well as target the pathogens [128, 129]. Christen et al. [130] explored this hypothesis, ‘‘In theory, a structural similarity or identity between the host and an invading pathogen might cause the immune system of the host to react not only to the pathogen but also to self-components.’’ Infections can act as environmental triggers inducing or promoting autoimmune disease in genetically predisposed individuals [131]; researchers have shown how antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are created in response to infectious agents [132, 133].
Vitamin D appears to have a positive effect on autoimmune disease due to immune system suppression [122, 134, 135] and immune suppression is considered therapeutically beneficial for autoimmune diseases [136, 137]. However, vitamin D proponents have failed to recognize that positive effects are due to the immunosuppressive effect of elevated 25(OH)D or to understand that immunosuppression is contraindicated because of the probable presence of intracellular infection. When the immune system is suppressed clinical disease markers and symptoms are reduced but immunosuppression does not address an underlying cause of persistent bacteria, thus relapse is common [138]. Verway et al. [79] wonder, ‘‘Is a specific pathogen responsible for disease or rather is a dysregulated immune response generated against a complex microbial population? Why would immune-suppressive drugs be efficacious if the primary defect is an immune deficiency?” Much of current research focuses on finding drugs to suppress inflammation but, according to Collins [139], 95 % of these studies have failed It seems clear a better direction is needed. Immunotherapy which restores VDR competence corrects dysregulated vitamin D metabolism and eliminates intracellular bacteria could be the answer (as discussed in the section titled Restoring VDR Competence).
!!!!Dysregulated vitamin D metabolism
In a healthy individual, the complex interplay between innate and adaptive immunity cooperates to mount an appropriate response to infection through regulation of the vitamin D endocrine system [140]. The immune system detects and responds to the presence of intracellular bacteria by producing more 1,25(OH)2D to activate the VDR and express the crucial endogenous AMPs which enable the innate immune system to target intracellular pathogens [141]. Renal production of 1,25(OH)2D is tightly selfregulated, with the end product down-regulating its own further production. In contrast, extra-renal tissues (e.g., uterine decidua and placenta, colon, breast, prostate, spleen, bone, keratinocytes, melanoma and synovial cells, pulmonary monocytes and macrophages, etc.) which produce 1,25(OH)2D are regulated by cytokines (e.g., interferon-gamma), lipopolysaccharide, nitric oxide and intracellular VDBP, which activate the enzyme CYP27B1 to stimulate conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D [142]. This extra-renal production of 1,25(OH)2D in tissues infected with intracellular bacteria can result in an excess in production of 1,25(OH)2D which may contribute to depletion and low levels of 25(OH)D [143] (Fig. 4).
Because extra-renal production of 1,25(OH)2D is primarily dependent on the availability of 25(OH)D [144], supplementation with vitamin D to increase 25(OH)D may promote the production of 1,25(OH)2D in non-renal tissues that are sites of intracellular infection and result in hypervitaminosis-D

{img attId="4412"}
Fig. 4 Proposed hypothesis for excess 1,25(OH)2D production in bacterially-stimulated extrarenal tissues. Extra-renal tissues, which produce 1,25(OH)2D, are regulated by cytokines, lipopolysaccharide, nitric oxide and intracellular VDBP, which activate the enzyme CYP27B1 to stimulate conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D, resulting in low 25(OH)D

{img attId="4413"}
Fig. 5 Proposed hypothesis for dysregulated vitamin D metabolism caused by intracellular pathogens. Theoretically, when nucleated cells are parasitized by intracellular bacteria, extra-renal production of 1,25(OH)2D increases, the kidneys lose control of 1,25(OH)2D production, and pro-hormone 25(OH)D decreases due to rapid conversion to 1,25(OH)2D

Sunlight appears to play a part in this process and many patients with autoimmune disease report sun sensitivity. The skin (dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes possess VDR) has the capacity to synthesize 1,25(OH)2D, and represents an important target tissue for 1,25(OH)2D [145]. If keratinocytes in the skin are infected, natural regulation of photosynthesis may be thwarted and solar energy may overstimulate cellular activity, resulting in an increase in cutaneous production of vitamin D3, 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D following sun exposure.
We hypothesize that when nucleated cells are parasitized by intracellular bacteria, extra-renal production of 1,25(OH)2D increases, the kidneys lose control of 1,25(OH)2D production, and pro-hormone 25(OH)D decreases due to rapid conversion to 1,25(OH)2D. 
The following mechanisms are thought to be responsible (Fig. 5):
*Inflammatory cytokines activate CYP27B1, an enzyme that causes more 25(OH)D to be converted to 1,25(OH)2D [146].
*The microbial-repressed VDR cannot transcribe CYP24A1 (formerly 24-hydroxylase), an enzyme that breaks down excess 1,25(OH)2D [147].
*Excess 1,25(OH)2D binds the PXR (pregnane X receptor), to inhibit conversion of vitamin D3 to 25(OH)D so 25(OH)D is down-regulated [148].
*1,25(OH)2D inhibits the hepatic synthesis of 25(OH)D [149].
Thus, low 25(OH)D may be a consequence of the inflammatory process. More studies are concluding that suboptimal circulating levels of vitamin D appear to be caused by the disease process. Waldronn et al. [150] found serum 25(OH)D was decreased following an acute inflammatory insult (i.e., orthopedic surgery) and concluded that hypovitaminosis-D may be the consequence rather than cause of chronic inflammatory diseases. Ferder et al. [151] state, there may be a relationship between inflammatory processes induced by chronic overstimulation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and the worldwide vitamin D deficiency. In fact, the pandemic of vitamin D deficiency could be the other face of increased RAS activity, which could potentially cause a lower activity or lower levels of Vitamin D.’’
!!!!Diagnosis of dysregulated vitamin D metabolism
Assessing dysregulated vitamin D metabolism has the potential to guide clinical practice [152, 153]. Vitamin D status is currently determined by measuring the level of serum 25(OH)D which, presumably, reflects the serum levels of other vitamin D metabolites (e.g., vitamin D3, vitamin D2 and 1,25(OH)2D, etc.). This measurement may not, however, provide enough information to assess vitamin D endocrine function. The clinical utility of measuring 1,25(OH)D is not fully understood, but it is clear that associations are being made between this active metabolite of vitamin D and disease states [154]. 1,25(OH)2D is not being used as a measure associated with vitamin D nutritional status or as an intermediate marker related to health outcomes, or even routinely assessed in vitamin D research. In the context of solving the puzzle of low 25(OH)D, the reasons cited for this lapse fail to consider the possibility of abnormal levels in the presence of chronic inflammation:
*1,25(OH)2D has a short half-life (hours) and fluctuates rapidly.
+However, a high result may be discovered even at trough level.
*1,25(OH)2D levels are regulated by PTH, calcium, phosphate.
+This is not true if extra-renal production is prevalent [143].
*1,25(OH)2D does not decrease until 25(OH)D is very low.
+A low 25(OH)D may be a sign that 1,25(OH)2D is abnormally high [55].
*1,25(OH)2D is only over-produced in hypercalcemic disease states such as sarcoidosis.
+Studies show this is not true [42].
*1,25(OH)2D may be elevated as a result of up- regulation of the CYP27B1 enzyme.
+This begs the question, Why is this enzyme elevated [146]?
Measuring both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D (and PTH, calcium, phosphate when indicated) as clinical markers in
Table 1 D-metabolites tests
Serum 25(OH)D [157]
CPT code: 82306 [157]
Lowest mortality reported at 20 ng/ml [158] Immunosuppression reported when higher than 30 ng/ml [122] Serum 1,25(OH)2D [157]
CPT code: 82652 [157]
ICD-9 code:
275.40 Disorder of calcium metabolism, unspecified [157] Maximum normal = 45 pg/ml [17]
chronic disease is more likely to provide a true picture of vitamin D status, than measuring 25(OH)D alone [155, 156] (Table 1). Measuring 1,25(OH)2D should be considered in patients with low 25(OH)D, abnormal laboratory results (especially inflammatory markers), a diagnosis of autoimmune disease or other chronic inflammatory illness, or signs of chronic systemic inflammation. For example, elevated 1,25(OH)2D may serve as a marker of Crohn’s disease [52]. The 1,25(OH)2D test is a delicate assay which is only done in specialized laboratories. False low results have been observed due to apparent sample mishandling; freezing for transport is advised to prevent sample degradation due to agitation. A high result is always accurate.
!!!!Restoration of VDR competence
The ability to mount an appropriate immune system response to intracellular infection is highly dependent on a competent VDR [159]. When it appears that 1,25(OH)2D is unable to up-regulate the VDR due to microbial activity, VDR competence may be restored with another VDR ligand which acts as an agonist; an agonist increases the signal transduction activity of a cell when bound to a receptor on that cell. Over 3000 synthetic VDR ligands have been identified, but most of these 1,25(OH)2D analogues have no clinical use because of their undue disruption to calcium regulation [160]. A number of nonvitamin D VDR ligands have also been identified: curcu- min, omega-6 fatty acids (e.g., arachidonic acid, linoleic acid), and lithocolic acid (LCA) but are not being used for this purpose [161, 162].
Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown, via in silico molecular modeling, to modulate VDR activation [163]. The most promising ARB, __olmesartan__ medoxomil (brand name Benicar®) was estimated to have a Ki value in the low nanomolar range, similar to the Ki values of the natural VDR ligands [163].

{img attId="4414"}
Fig. 6 Proposed hypothesis for restoring renal control of 1,25(OH)2D with __olmesartan__. __olmesartan__ is believed to decrease elevated 1,25(OH)2D by several mechanisms

__Olmesartan__ has been noted to cause a significant reduction in elevated 1,25(OH)2D within weeks of initiation, which provides
further evidence of its ability to up-regulate the VDR [164]. __olmesartan__ is believed to decrease elevated 1,25(OH)2D by several VDR-mediated effects (Fig. 6). The up-regulated VDR:
*transcribes CYP24A1 and CYP3A4 (enzymes which reduce 1,25(OH)2D production) [147].
*represses CYP27B1 (the enzyme that hydroxylates 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D) so less 1,25(OH)2D is produced [146].
Consequently, renal control of 1,25(OH)2D production is restored and extra-renal production of 1,25(OH)2D is reduced. A decrease in elevated 1,25(OH)2D means less systemic inflammation, as these studies of __olmesartan__ indicate:
*Improvement of glycemic control and insulin resistance was only observed in the __olmesartan__ group and these effects of __olmesartan__ might be mediated by an antiinflammatory action [165].
*__Olmesartan__ treatment significantly reduced serum levels of inflammatory markers; h-CRP, h-TNFa, IL-6, MCP-1 after 6 weeks of therapy [166].
*Blocking angiotensin-converting enzyme induces potent regulatory T cells and modulates TH1- and TH17-mediated autoimmunity [167].
*Blocking angiotensin II receptor increases bone mass [168, 169].
__Olmesartan__ acts in a manner similar to 1,25(OH)2D to reduce inflammation and, by inference, improve immune system function. VDR and RAS receptors are distributed in almost the same tissues. The endogenous VDR ligand 1,25(OH)2D down-regulates the RAS by repressing renin gene expression to reduce inflammation via the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway [170]. __olmesartan__ has a similar effect in that it reduces angiotensin II (a peptide that is implicated in the inflammatory process) [171]. Inappropriate stimulation of the RAS has been associated with the pathogenesis of hypertension, heart attack and stroke [151]. Ferder et al. [151] state, ‘‘Changes in RAS activity and activation of the VDR seem to be inversely related, making it possible to speculate that both systems could have a feedback relationship. The combination of RAS blockade and VDR stimulation appears to be more effective than each one used individually.” Blocking angiotensin II and stimulating the VDR is what __olmesartan__ appears to accomplish and this function is consistent with a theory of VDR incompetence (Fig. 7).
In patients with autoimmune disorders and inflammatory symptoms, __olmesartan__ is noted to provoke an increase in inflammatory symptoms indicative of a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (JHR). JHR is a cascade of reactions including inflammation, cytokine release, and endotoxin release as part of the immune response to the disintegration of infected cells [172]. This immunopathology suggests transcription of AMPs by an activated VDR, points to the presence of occult infection and provides additional evidence that __olmesartan__ is a VDR agonist [167, 173, 174]. Theoretically, __olmesartan__ restores VDR competence and, thus, phagocytosis leads to bacterial death; consequently, inflammation is temporarily increased by cytokine reaction to microbial endotoxins and cellular debris from dead host cells and bacteria [175].
Hajishengallis and Lambris [92] conclude that a blockade of hijacked receptors of the innate immune system may offer promising options to control infection and associated immunopathology. Although this use of __olmesartan__ is off- label, its safety profile is well established [176]. The multiple, documented beneficial effects of __olmesartan__, including the ability to reduce cardiovascular and kidney disease, prevent migraines, and reduce oxidative stress, also suggest it could play a key role in the resolution of chronic systemic inflammation [177, 178].
!!!!Clinical use of __olmesartan__
__Olmesartan__ is being used as a novel VDR ligand in the clinical setting [179]. Immunotherapy with __olmesartan__ may also include pulsed administration of select MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) oral antibiotics to weaken and help eradicate the intracellular pathogens. With each antibiotic dose, inflammatory symptoms (JHR) wax and wane, providing further evidence of persistent infection [180]. Changes in laboratory findings (e.g., BUN, creatinine, CRP, blood counts, liver enzymes) often point to areas of occult inflammation. A correlating treatment strategy is the avoidance of excessive sunlight exposure, foods high in vitamin D and vitamin D supplements to maintain serum 25(OH)D at a level (20-30 ng/ml) that is not likely to suppress the immune system and inhibit bacterial elimination [122, 135, 137].
Accumulating case reports now support the observation that a number of complex, chronic conditions can be improved by restoring VDR function using this type of immunotherapy [179, 181, 182]. It is becoming increasingly clear that microbes slow down immune reactivity by dysregulating the VDR, ultimately to increase their chance of survival. Immune modulatory therapies that enhance VDR expression and activity should, therefore, be considered in the clinical setting [183].
!!!!Discussion
Vitamin D is essential for many important biological processes and most people get an adequate supply from exposure to sunlight (Table 2). Long-term studies are needed to determine if low 25(OH)D in healthy individuals leads to disease. Evidence that vitamin D supplementation cures or prevents chronic disease is inconsistent. Despite increased supplementation chronic inflammatory diseases are on the rise. Attention to the alternate hypothesis—low 25(OH)D is a consequence of the chronic disease process, provoked by persistent intracellular infection—may be crucial to reversing this trend and needs further research.

!!!!Table 2 Key points
*Vitamin D is a steroid hormone which regulates immune system function
*Photosynthesis of vitamin D3 provides adequate vitamin D stores for most individuals
*Low levels of 25(OH)D are seen in healthy individuals, as well as those with chronic inflammatory conditions
*Studies are inconsistent regarding the health benefits of increasing vitamin D stores; vitamin D supplementation may have negative effects
*25(OH)D may not always reflect the level of 1,25(OH)D; accurate assessment of vitamin D status depends on measuring both metabolites
*Intracellular, cell wall deficient bacteria may cause dysregulated vitamin D metabolism and impaired immune system function
*A novel, non-vitamin D VDR ligand (an angiotensin receptor blocker) appears to 
+reactivate the immune system, 
+restore VDR competence, 
+correct dysregulated vitamin D metabolism and 
+reduce inflammatory symptoms
The prevailing dogma that the level of serum 25(OH)D provides an accurate assessment of vitamin D status needs closer examination. Circulating levels of 25(OH)D may not be an accurate reflection of vitamin D status. In those with an autoimmune disease or chronic inflammatory symptoms, 1,25(OH)2D may be elevated. This can lead to osteoporosis and cause inhibition of innate immunity, which is contraindicated in the presence of infection. The resulting immunosuppression may promote persistentinfection which has been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases.
Human cells live in harmony with many types of microbes but some microbes may become pathogenic under commonly experienced conditions. The innate immune system is designed to kill pathogens via 1,25(OH)2D- mediated VDR transcription of anti-microbial peptides but microbes may use strategies which down-regulate the VDR in order to live and reproduce within nucleated host cells. Studies using more advanced cell culture and molecular techniques are confirming the presence of previously undetected intracellular bacteria. Defense mechanisms that intracellular bacteria use to persist and proliferate need to be investigated. Pathogen-induced VDR dysfunction which causes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines appears to be at the root of chronic disease and low 25(OH)D. Improving VDR activation may be the key to reducing inflammatory diseases. Treatments that up-regulate the VDR to restore normal immune function, reduce inflammation and eradicate persistent bacterial infections require further research. An immunotherapy which has demonstrated efficacy in reversing vitamin D metabolism dysfunction and reducing inflammatory symptoms is currently being used by clinicians and warrants formal study.
In summary, elevated 1,25(OH)2D, often accompanied by reduced 25(OH)D, is a clinical sign of dysregulated vitamin D metabolism and evidence that the immune system is competing with parasitic microbes for VDR dominance. Failure of the immune system to mount an effective anti-microbial response results in persistent intracellular infection. This induces relentless inflammation (immunopathology) which causes tissue damage and disease symptoms.

&lt;p>Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency has increased in the general population and become an important public health issue.1 Vitamin D is mainly known for its favorable effects in calcium and bone metabolism. However, increasing numbers of studies have established that vitamin D insufficiency contributes to a number of diseases, suggesting a range of physiological functions of vitamin D.M Several clinical studies have confirmed that vitamin D plays a crucial role in modulating innate immune responses toward various pathogens.5 Moreover, recent studies indicate that vitamin D can regulate the adaptive immune response in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.6,7 These results suggest the beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation in decreasing the risk and adverse outcomes of inflammatory diseases, although the precise effect remains to be elucidated in large clinical trials.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blood tests can be a poor measure of actual vitamin D due to D Binding Protein (DBP)</title><link>/posts/blood-tests-can-be-a-poor-measure-of-actual-vitamin-d-due-to-d-binding-protein-dbp.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/blood-tests-can-be-a-poor-measure-of-actual-vitamin-d-due-to-d-binding-protein-dbp.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Vitamin D Binding Protein Impact on 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels under Different Physiologic and Pathologic Conditions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in regulating gene expression. The main mechanisms involve methylation of DNA and covalent modifications of histones by methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or ubiquitination. The complex interplay of different epigenetic mechanisms is mediated by enzymes acting in the nucleus. Modifications in DNA methylation are performed mainly by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins, while a plethora of enzymes, such as histone acetyltransferases (HATs), histone deacetylases (HDACs), histone methyltransferases (HMTs), and histone demethylases (HDMs) regulate covalent histone modifications. In many diseases, such as cancer, the epigenetic regulatory system is often disturbed. Vitamin D interacts with the epigenome on multiple levels.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Colon cancer more likely in blacks due to differences in Vitamin D genes (wonder if more Vitamin D would help)</title><link>/posts/colon-cancer-more-likely-in-blacks-due-to-differences-in-vitamin-d-genes-wonder--in-d-would-help.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/colon-cancer-more-likely-in-blacks-due-to-differences-in-vitamin-d-genes-wonder--in-d-would-help.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>PURPOSE:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Disparities in both colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and survival impact African Americans (AAs) more than other US ethnic groups. Because vitamin D is thought to protect against CRC and AAs have lower serum vitamin D levels, genetic variants that modulate the levels of active hormone in the tissues could explain some of the cancer health disparity. Consequently, we hypothesized that genetic variants in vitamin D-related genes are associated with CRC risk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Colorectal cancer – need more vitamin D if you have certain genes</title><link>/posts/colorectal-cancer-need-more-vitamin-d-if-you-have-certain-genes.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/colorectal-cancer-need-more-vitamin-d-if-you-have-certain-genes.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="serum-vitamin-d-metabolites-in-colorectal-cancer-patients-receiving-cholecalciferol-supplementation-correlation-with-polymorphisms-in-the-vitamin-d-genes">Serum vitamin D metabolites in colorectal cancer patients receiving cholecalciferol supplementation: correlation with polymorphisms in the vitamin D genes.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Cholecalciferol (D(3)) supplementation results in variable increases in serum 25(OH)D(3) levels, however, the influence of genetic polymorphisms on these variable responses is unclear. We measured serum 25(OH)D(3), 24,25(OH)(2)D(3), 1,25(OH)2D(3) and VDBP levels in 50 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients before and during &lt;strong>2,000 IU&lt;/strong> daily oral D(3) supplementation for six months and in 263 archived CRC serum samples. Serum PTH levels and PBMC 24-OHase activity were also measured during D(3) supplementation. TagSNPs in CYP2R1, CYP27A1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, VDR, and GC genes were genotyped in all patients, and the association between these SNPs and serum vitamin D(3) metabolites levels before and after D(3) supplementation was analyzed. The mean baseline serum 25(OH)D(3) level was less than 32 ng/mL in 65 % of the 313 CRC patients.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Retina can activate Vitamin D</title><link>/posts/retina-can-activate-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/retina-can-activate-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="characterization-of-vitamin-d-production-by-human-ocular-barrier-cells">Characterization of vitamin D production by human ocular barrier cells.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Allelic variation in the vitamin D receptor was the first non-structural gene to be associated with osteoporosis, and together with the effects of the vitamin D system on bone homeostasis, suggested that this vitamin might have a strong role in bone health. However, controversy exists regarding what level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is optimal. Current data from biochemical, observational and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), indicate serum 25(OH)D levels of at least 50 nmol l−1 are required for normalization of parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, to minimize the risk of osteomalacia and for optimal bone cell function. The skeletal consequences of 25(OH)D insufficiency include secondary hyperparathyroidism, increased bone turnover and bone loss and an increased risk of minimal trauma fractures. In large scale epidemiological studies, serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with bone mineral density in both men and women. However, there is mixed evidence on the effectiveness of optimizing serum 25(OH)D levels for the prevention of bone loss and minimal trauma fractures in postmenopausal women and older men. There may be some benefit on primary fracture prevention for those who have inadequate serum levels of 25(OH)D, particularly in institutionalised elderly patients, but only when combined with calcium supplements. For optimal bone health, evidence from RCTs suggests vitamin D may be considered a threshold nutrient with few further bone benefits observed at levels of 25(OH)D above which PTH is normalized. An adequate calcium intake is also imperative to gain optimum benefit from an improved vitamin D status in those with insufficient 25(OH)D levels, with an increased calcium intake being associated with suppression of PTH levels.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D Receptor can be modulated with a new compound</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-receptor-can-be-modulated-with-a-new-compound.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-receptor-can-be-modulated-with-a-new-compound.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="development-of-novel-vitamin-d-receptor-coactivator-inhibitors">Development of novel Vitamin D Receptor-Coactivator Inhibitors.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Abstract&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Williams-Beuren syndrome is a rare genetic disorder, caused by the deletion of 26-28 genes on chromosome 7. Fifteen percent of Williams-Beuren syndrome patients present with hypercalcaemia during infancy, which is generally mild and resolves spontaneously before the age of 4 years. The mechanisms underlying the transient hypercalcaemia in Williams-Beuren syndrome are poorly understood.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Atherogenesis, atherosclerosis and vitamin D – review</title><link>/posts/atherogenesis-atherosclerosis-and-vitamin-d-review.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/atherogenesis-atherosclerosis-and-vitamin-d-review.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-role-of-the-intraplaque-vitamin-d-system-in-atherogenesis">The Role of the Intraplaque Vitamin D System in Atherogenesis&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>The biological actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) serve both to orchestrate calcium and phosphorus homeostasis in higher vertebrates and to regulate a diverse set of cellular functions unrelated to control of mineral metabolism. With regard to bone, mesenchymal lineage cells, including both early and late osteoblasts as well as osteocytes represent classic targets of the vitamin D hormone. Accordingly, much of the early information regarding our current understanding of the mechanism of action of 1,25(OH)2D3, of which gene regulation is central, derives from a broad array of studies in these cell types. Indeed, a gene that provided both the earliest and perhaps the most extensive information regarding this and additional mechanisms was that of osteoblast-specific osteocalcin. Subsequent work has provided much additional detail as to how 1,25(OH)2D3, through the vitamin D receptor (VDR), mediates the modulation of many bone cell genes. In recent years, however, a series of technical advances involving the coupling of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to unbiased methodologies that involve next-generation DNA sequencing techniques (ChIP-seq) have opened new avenues in the study of gene regulation. In this review, we summarize early work and then focus on more recent studies that have used ChIP-seq analysis and other approaches to provide insight into not only the regulation of specific genes such as the VDR, TNFSF11 (RANKL), LRP5, CBS and CYP24a1, but overarching genome-wide principles of gene regulation as well. The results of these studies highlight the value of these new approaches and the increased insight that can be gained.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D and its active metabolites – DeLuca</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-and-its-active-metabolites-deluca.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-and-its-active-metabolites-deluca.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="history-of-the-discovery-of-vitamin-d-and-its-active-metabolites">History of the discovery of vitamin D and its active metabolites&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Before the twentieth century, it was not possible to describe the essentials of a diet that could support life, growth and reproduction of higher animals. The discovery of vitamin A by McCollum and Davis in 1913 ushered in the era of accessory food substances culminating in the achievement of that goal. It included the discovery of vitamin D and its production in skin caused by ultraviolet light. This was followed by a description of its actions at the physiological level that resulted in a healthy skeleton and beyond. To carry out these functions, vitamin D is converted to a hormone that acts through a nuclear receptor. The findings leading to this concept and their importance to biology and medicine are presented.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D proven to treat or prevent many cancers in animals, but only breast cancer in humans so far</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-proven-to-treat-or-prevent-many-cancers-in-animals-but-only-breast-cancer-in-humans-so-far.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-proven-to-treat-or-prevent-many-cancers-in-animals-but-only-breast-cancer-in-humans-so-far.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>The negative association of the latitude where people live and the incidence of non cutaneous cancer in that population in North America have been demonstrated in many studies for many types of cancer. Since the intensity of UVB exposure decreases with increasing latitude, and UVB exposure provides the mechanism for vitamin D production in the skin, the hypothesis that increased vitamin D provides protection against the development of cancer has been proposed. This hypothesis has been tested in a substantial number of prospective and case control studies and in a few randomized clinical trials (RTC) assessing whether either vitamin D intake or serum levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) correlate (inversely) with cancer development. Most of the studies have focused on colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer. The results have been mixed. The most compelling data for a beneficial relationship between vitamin D intake or serum 25OHD levels and cancer have been obtained for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D: calcium and bone homeostasis during evolution</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-calcium-and-bone-homeostasis-during-evolution.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-calcium-and-bone-homeostasis-during-evolution.html</guid><description>&lt;p>BoneKEy Reports 3, Article number: 480 (2014) | doi:10.1038/bonekey.2013.214&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Vitamin D3 is already found early in the evolution of life but essentially as inactive end products of the photochemical reaction of 7-dehydrocholestol with ultraviolet light B. A full vitamin D (refers to vitamin D2 and D3) endocrine system, characterized by a specific VDR (vitamin D receptor, member of the nuclear receptor family), specific vitamin D metabolizing CYP450 enzymes regulated by calciotropic hormones and a dedicated plasma transport-protein is only found in vertebrates. In the earliest vertebrates (lamprey), vitamin D metabolism and VDR may well have originated from a duplication of a common PRX/VDR ancestor gene as part of a xenobiotic detoxification pathway. The vitamin D endocrine system, however, subsequently became an important regulator of calcium supply for an extensive calcified skeleton. Vitamin D is essential for normal calcium and bone homeostasis as shown by rickets in vitamin D-deficient growing amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. From amphibians onward, bone is gradually more dynamic with regulated bone resorption, mainly by combined action of PTH and 1 a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) on the generation and function of multinucleated osteoclasts. Therefore, bone functions as a large internal calcium reservoir, under the control of osteoclasts. Osteocytes also display a remarkable spectrum of activities, including mechanical sensing and regulating mineral homeostasis, but also have an important role in global nutritional and energy homeostasis. Mineralization from reptiles onward is under the control of well-regulated SIBLING proteins and associated enzymes, nearly all under the control of 1,25(OH)2D3. The vitamin D story thus started as inert molecule but gained an essential role for calcium and bone homeostasis in terrestrial animals to cope with the challenge of higher gravity and calcium-poor environment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Parkinson’s Disease relationship to Vitamin D</title><link>/posts/parkinsons-disease-relationship-to-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/parkinsons-disease-relationship-to-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Significance: Although the vitamin D endocrine system has been well defined and the enzyme responsible for converting 25-hydroxyvitamin D to the final hormone, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, is well understood, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of vitamin D to the blood form, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, has not been clearly identified. A case has been made for vitamin D 25-hydroxylase CYP2R1 as the responsible enzyme, but proof is lacking. We have produced a null mutant mouse lacking CYP2R1. With this model, we have shown that CYP2R1 is the major but not exclusive 25-hydroxylase and that there remains another significant enzyme responsible for this step in vitamin D activation that has yet to be identified.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the importance of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/fatty-liver-disease-nafld-and-the-importance-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/fatty-liver-disease-nafld-and-the-importance-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 class="svTitle">

&lt;p>The growing attention to the role of vitamin D in skeletal and extra-skeletal diseases over the last decade, induced an increased demand for Vitamin D determination as well as a dramatic rise of sales of vitamin D supplement. However, several critical points in this field remain to be clarified. We lack a clear consensus about the definition of vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency and sufficiency. The identification of different thresholds defining vitamin D status have relevant implications in clinical practice. In fact, the worldwide prevalence of low vitamin D status is highly varying according to the level of 25(OH)D utilized to define sufficiency. Therefore, the assessment of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels may have a critical role, but a number of different technical problems associated with its determination may interfere in interpreting the results. The hydrophobic nature of the vitamin D and the tight binding to its carrier (vitamin D binding protein, DBP), the different forms circulating in blood and the issue of standardisation are among the most important factors influencing the measurement of this metabolite. Another controversial point relies on the conflicting guidance on prevention and treatment of vitamin D deficiency endorsed by different medical and scientific communities. In particular, uncertainty exists about how to replete vitamin D stores, how to maintain normal 25(OH)D levels after repletion, which form of vitamin D is preferable for supplementation, which route of administration and dosing regimens are advisable. Finally, concerns have been raised regarding vitamin D toxicity and its adverse effects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>40 percent less likely to get adequate vitamin D response if have certain genes</title><link>/posts/40-percent-less-likely-to-get-adequate-vitamin-d-response-if-have-certain-genes.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/40-percent-less-likely-to-get-adequate-vitamin-d-response-if-have-certain-genes.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-intake-and-season-modify-the-effects-of-the-gc-and-cyp2r1-genes-on-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-concentrations">Vitamin D intake and season modify the effects of the GC and CYP2R1 genes on 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.&lt;/h3>

However, there remains cynicism about the lack of randomized controlled trials to support the association studies regarding the nonskeletal health benefits of vitamin D. This review was obtained by searching English-language studies published up to April 1, 2013, in PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (search terms: vitamin D and supplementation) and focuses on recent challenges regarding the definition of vitamin D deficiency and how to achieve optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations from dietary sources, supplements, and sun exposure. The effect of vitamin D on fetal programming epigenetics and gene regulation could potentially explain why vitamin D has been reported to have such wide-ranging health benefits throughout life. There is potentially a great upside to increasing the vitamin D status of children and adults worldwide for improving musculoskeletal health and reducing the risk of chronic illnesses, including some cancers, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, neurocognitive disorders, and mortality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hypovitaminosis D in the Middle East and North Africa</title><link>/posts/hypovitaminosis-d-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hypovitaminosis-d-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 class="showhide_heading" id="Hypovitaminosis_D_in_the_Middle_East_and_North_Africa:_Prevalence_risk_factors_and_impact_on_outcomes">

&lt;p>Hypovitaminosis D is a very common disorder, regarding both Western and developing countries. A growing amount of data over the last years have shown vitamin D deficiency to be high prevalent among HIV-positive subjects. In addition to &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; risk factors, such as female sex, low dietary intake, dark skin pigmentation and low sun exposure, HlV-related factors, including immune activation and anti-retroviral adverse effects, may affect vitamin D status. Even if both protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have been associated with low vitamin D levels, available evidences have failed to univocally associate hypovitaminosis D with specific antiretroviral class effects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Investigation on Roundup - glyphosate at VitaminDWiki</title><link>/posts/investigation-on-roundup-glyphosate-at-vitamindwiki.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/investigation-on-roundup-glyphosate-at-vitamindwiki.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>This is an attempt to see if Roundup/Glyphosate causes problems with Vitamin D - started May 2013&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Objective: Low vitamin D (VD) levels are common in obesity. We hypothesized that this may be due to metabolism of VD in &lt;strong>adipose tissue&lt;/strong> (AT). Thus, we studied (1) whether the VD-metabolizing enzymes were expressed differently in AT of lean and obese individuals and in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and (2) whether their expression was influenced by weight loss.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Poorly functioning Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) was 5X more likely in children with low vitamin D levels</title><link>/posts/poorly-functioning-vitamin-d-receptor-vdr-was-5x-more-likely-in-children-with-low-vitamin-d-levels.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/poorly-functioning-vitamin-d-receptor-vdr-was-5x-more-likely-in-children-with-low-vitamin-d-levels.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="association-of-vitamin-d-related-gene-polymorphisms-with-manifestation-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children">Association of vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms with manifestation of vitamin D deficiency in children.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, presenting as hypocalcemic seizures or rickets in children, is increasing worldwide due to insufficient vitamin D intake and lack of exposure to sunshine. However, considering that relatively few children with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> levels manifest symptoms, it is possible that genetic factors may predispose individuals to vitamin D deficiency. Recent twin studies have reported that the level of serum of 25(OH)D is influenced by genetic factors. In addition, genome-wide association studies and candidate gene studies have revealed that several vitamin D-related genes, including VDR, GC, NADSYN1, CYP2R1, CYP24A1, CYP27B1, and C10orf88 contribute to variations in serum 25(OH)D levels. To investigate whether genetic predisposition contributes to vitamin D deficiency, we analyzed polymorphisms in vitamin D-related genes in 30 Japanese patients with vitamin D deficiency presenting at less than 4 years of age, along with 66 controls. A χ(2) test showed that the genotype frequencies of BsmI polymorphism in VDR and rs10898191 in NADSYN1 were significantly different between the two groups. The allele frequencies of BsmI, ApaI, TaqI in VDR, rs10898191 in NADSYN1, and rs705117 in GC were also significantly different. In particular, the frequency of the BAtS haplotype in VDR was significantly increased in the patient group relative to controls (p = 0.0014; odds ratio, &lt;strong>5.61&lt;/strong> ; 95% confidence interval 1.92 - 16.40). Although this is a small study, our findings suggest that VDR, NADSYN1, and GC polymorphisms may be linked to the manifestation of vitamin D deficiency in Japanese children.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Autoimmunity, T Cells and vitamin D: A chemical network analysis</title><link>/posts/autoimmunity-t-cells-and-vitamin-d-a-chemical-network-analysis.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/autoimmunity-t-cells-and-vitamin-d-a-chemical-network-analysis.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-sensitivity-to-the-immune-responses-and-autoimmunity-a-chemical-network-model-study">Vitamin D sensitivity to the immune responses and autoimmunity: A chemical network model study&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Although Vitamin D is believed to be involved in a large number of immune responses our understanding of these processes at cellular level remained at infancy. We develop and solve a coarse grained kinetic network model to quantify the effects of variation of vitamin D on human immunity. The system of equations accounts for known inter-relation between active and inactive vitamin D, antigen presenting cells, effector T cells, regulatory T cells and pathogen. Both time dependent and steady state solutions are obtained. The time dependent solution of the system of equations reveals that the immune response is rather strongly regulated in presence of vitamin D. We found quantitatively that lower than optimum levels of concentration of active vitamin D correspond to weak regulation where, once a pathogen/antigen enters the body, the nature of the immune response would be less regulatory and hence more aggressive, or inflammatory. The steady state solution of our model shows that vitamin D enhances the tolerance level of immune system, thereby increasing resistance to autoimmune diseases. Our model and accompanied numerical analyses reveal another important aspect of immunity: While extremely low levels of vitamin D could lead to increased risk of autoimmune responses, an overdose (toxic) level would give rise to too large a tolerant response, leading to the increased risk of tumors and cancerous cell growth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>16th Vitamin D Workshop and Vitamin D portion of ENDO</title><link>/posts/16th-vitamin-d-workshop-and-vitamin-d-portion-of-endo.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/16th-vitamin-d-workshop-and-vitamin-d-portion-of-endo.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="preliminary-workshop-program-as-of-spring-2013">Preliminary Workshop Program as of Spring 2013&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Vitamin D is well known for its effects on promoting bone mineralization as the primary characteristic of rickets, and osteomalacia refers to decreased mineralization of the bone matrix. However, the direct effects of the vitamin D endocrine system on bone cells need further clarification. Earlier studies revealed that overexpression of VDR in osteoblasts (driven by osteocalcin promoter) increased bone mass and strength.1 Deletion of VDR in osteocytes (using a dmp1 cre system) did not influence bone mass or other parameters of bone metabolism.2 Deletion of VDR in osteoblasts using an osteocalcin cre system, however, increased (&amp;gt;20%) bone mass (total and trabecular femoral bone, mainly by increase in the number of trabeculae) as reported by Anderson et al.3 and by S Kato (presented at the 2012 Endocrine Society Meeting as summarized in Bouillon4). However, the mechanisms involved are not clear, as preliminary data suggested increase bone formation (as reported by Anderson et al.3) and decreased bone resorption in the Japanese osteoblast-selective VDR mice. These observations imply that VDR activation can have beneficial effects (prevent rickets and osteomalacia) but can also impair bone formation or mineralization in case of exposure to very high serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D.2, 5 Such negative effects of vitamin D on mineral deposition were also observed by studying the gene expression profile after exposure to 1,25(OH)2D (Pike’s group, as reported in the previous BoneKey Report4) and now in a series of in vitro experiments using osteoblasts from different regions (calvaria and femur). Exposure to 1,25(OH)2D could inhibit mineral deposition in early-stage calvaria-derived osteoblasts, whereas it enhanced mineral deposition in more mature cortical-bone-derived osteoblasts, at least in the presence of high extracellular calcium concentration.6 The direct effects of the vitamin D endocrine system on bone cells were also explored by analyzing mice with transgenic overexpression of cyp27b1 in osteoblasts using an osteocalcin promoter region. At 20 weeks of age, such mice displayed a 10% increase in bone volume as well in the lumbar vertebrae as in the femoral metaphysis.7 This beneficial effect was due to increased bone formation with unaltered bone resorption, indicating a direct bone anabolic effect of locally produced 1,25(OH)2D in osteoblasts. All these new observations indicate that the vitamin D endocrine system has a yin/yang effect on bone: in most circumstances it enhances mineral deposition but in the presence of low calcium supply the vitamin D endocrine system tries to maintain serum calcium homeostasis at the expense of bone (increased resorption and decreased mineralization).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Genes in white blood cells of blacks associated with vitamin D deficiency</title><link>/posts/genes-in-white-blood-cells-of-blacks-associated-with-vitamin-d-deficiency.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/genes-in-white-blood-cells-of-blacks-associated-with-vitamin-d-deficiency.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="a-genome-wide-methylation-study-of-severe-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-african-american-adolescents">A Genome-Wide Methylation Study of Severe Vitamin D Deficiency in African American Adolescents&lt;/h2>

Since sufficient Ca2+ absorption is essential for skeletal growth, our discovery may explain findings that excessive consumption of sweeteners compromises bone integrity in children.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Genes and different vitamin D related substances in the skin</title><link>/posts/genes-and-different-vitamin-d-related-substances-in-the-skin.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/genes-and-different-vitamin-d-related-substances-in-the-skin.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="novel-vitamin-d-photoproducts-and-their-precursors-in-the-skin">Novel vitamin D photoproducts and their precursors in the skin&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Objective:Observational studies have examined the link between vitamin D deficiency and obesity traits. Some studies have reported associations between vitamin D pathway genes such as VDR, GC and CYP27B1 with body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC); however, the findings have been inconsistent. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of vitamin D metabolic pathway genes in obesity-related traits in a large population-based study.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>If have breast cancer, should increase vitamin D to more than 30 ng</title><link>/posts/if-have-breast-cancer-should-increase-vitamin-d-to-more-than-30-ng.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/if-have-breast-cancer-should-increase-vitamin-d-to-more-than-30-ng.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-and-breast-cancer">Vitamin D and Breast Cancer&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>In addition to its role in calcium homeostasis and bone health, vitamin D has also been reported to have anticancer activities against many cancer types, including breast cancer. The discovery that breast epithelial cells possess the same enzymatic system as the kidney, allowing local manufacture of active vitamin D from circulating precursors, makes the effect of vitamin D in breast cancer biologically plausible. Preclinical and ecologic studies have suggested a role for vitamin D in breast cancer prevention. Inverse associations have also been shown between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (25(OH)D) and breast cancer development, risk for breast cancer recurrence, and mortality in women with early-stage breast cancer. Clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation, however, have yielded inconsistent results. Regardless of whether or not vitamin D helps prevent breast cancer or its recurrence, vitamin D deficiency in the U.S. population is very common, and the adverse impact on bone health, a particular concern for breast cancer survivors, makes it important to understand vitamin D physiology and to recognize and treat vitamin D deficiency. In this review, we discuss vitamin D metabolism and its mechanism of action. We summarize the current evidence of the relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer, highlight ongoing research in this area, and discuss optimal dosing of vitamin D for breast cancer prevention.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D can inhibit enveloped virus (e.g. Corona, Herpes, Bird Flu, Epstein, Hepatitis, RSV, etc.)</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-can-inhibit-enveloped-virus-eg-corona-herpes-bird-flu-epstein-hepatitis-rsv-etc.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-can-inhibit-enveloped-virus-eg-corona-herpes-bird-flu-epstein-hepatitis-rsv-etc.html</guid><description>&lt;!-- ~tc~ start ~/tc~ -->

New research has identified 1,25(OH)D as also vital for respiratory health. Due to its intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties, 1,25(OH)D may be very important in people with asthma. This review article seeks to evaluate the current literature to delineate the potential mechanisms of action by which 1,25(OH)D impacts asthma. We summarize the evidence that 1,25(OH)D has receptors in multiple lung cell types and acts to abrogate asthma by several mechanisms: by promoting lung immunity, by decreasing inflammation, by slowing cell cycling, by reducing hyperplasia, and by enhancing the effects of exogenous steroids. Put together, there is compelling evidence for the role of vitamin D in asthma.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D Wiki News for Dec 2012 and</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-wiki-news-for-dec-2012-and.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-wiki-news-for-dec-2012-and.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Lots of great vitamin D news - here are some news clusters.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It has been more than 100 years when it was first appreciated that increased sun exposure reduced risk of dying of cancer. The most beneficial effect of sun exposure is the production of vitamin D in the skin. Recent evidence suggests that most cells in the body not only have a vitamin D receptor but also have the capacity to convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Once formed 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D can inhibit cellular proliferation, induce cellular maturation, inhibit angiogenesis and ultimately cause apoptosis to prevent malignancy. A multitude of studies have associated improved vitamin D status with decreased risk for developing several deadly cancers including colon, breast, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. Patients with cancer are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency. Sensible sun exposure, vitamin D fortification and vitamin D supplementation should be encouraged to improve the vitamin D status of children and adults not only for bone health but for reducing risk of developing and dying of cancer. The goal is to achieve a blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 40-60 ng/mL. This can be accomplished by children taking 600-1000 and adults 1500-2000 international units (IU) vitamin D daily from diet and supplements along with sensible sun exposure when the sun is capable of producing vitamin D in the skin.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GC and CYP2R1 genes associated with higher summer vitamin D levels</title><link>/posts/gc-and-cyp2r1-genes-associated-with-higher-summer-vitamin-d-levels.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/gc-and-cyp2r1-genes-associated-with-higher-summer-vitamin-d-levels.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-intake-and-season-modify-the-effects-of-the-gc-and-cyp2r1-genes-on-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-concentrations123">Vitamin D Intake and Season Modify the Effects of the GC and CYP2R1 Genes on 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations1,2,3&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Patients with chronic renal disease have elevated serum phosphate levels, elevated fibroblast-like growth factor 23 (FGF-23), and declining vitamin D status. These changes are related and may be responsible for elevated 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) and dysfunctional vitamin D metabolism. This review focuses on the biochemistry and pathophysiology of CYP24A1 and the utility of blocking this enzyme with CYP24A1 inhibitors in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CYP24A1 gene in cancer cells may actually remove vitamin D from the blood</title><link>/posts/cyp24a1-gene-in-cancer-cells-may-actually-remove-vitamin-d-from-the-blood.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cyp24a1-gene-in-cancer-cells-may-actually-remove-vitamin-d-from-the-blood.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="24-hydroxylase-in-cancer-impact-on-vitamin-d-based-anticancer-therapeutics">24-Hydroxylase in Cancer: Impact on Vitamin D-based Anticancer Therapeutics.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>The active vitamin D hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) plays a major role in regulating calcium homeostasis and bone mineralization. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) also modulates cellular proliferation and differentiation in a variety of cell types. 24-hydroxylase, encoded by the CYP24A1 gene, is the key enzyme which converts 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) to less active calcitroic acid.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
