 **Highlights** 

* Prenatal 28,000 IU vitamin D3/week reduced CTx at delivery, compared to placebo.

* Effect of vitamin D on CTx at delivery mediated by reduction in parathyroid hormone.

* At 6 months postpartum, the effect of high-dose vitamin D on CTx was not sustained.

Vitamin D is a key regulator of bone mineral homeostasis and may modulate maternal bone health during pregnancy and postpartum. Using previously-collected data from the Maternal Vitamin D for Infant Growth (MDIG) trial in Dhaka, Bangladesh, we aimed to investigate the effects of prenatal and postpartum vitamin D3 supplementation on circulating biomarkers of bone formation and resorption at delivery and 6 months postpartum. MDIG trial participants were randomized to receive a prenatal;postpartum regimen of placebo or vitamin D3 (IU/week) as either 0;0 (Group A), 4200;0 (B), 16,800;0 (C), 28,000;0 (D) or 28,000;28,000 (E) from 17 to 24 weeks' gestation to 6 months postpartum. As this sub-study was not pre-planned, the study sample included MDIG participants who had data for at least 1 biomarker of interest at delivery or 6 months postpartum, with a corresponding baseline measurement (n = 690; 53 % of 1300 enrolled trial participants). Biomarkers related to bone turnover were measured in maternal venous blood samples collected at enrolment, delivery, and 6 months postpartum: osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteocalcin (OC), receptor activator nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide, (P1NP) and carboxy terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTx). Supplementation effects were expressed as percent differences between each vitamin D group and placebo with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). Of 690 participants, 64 % had 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (25OHD) <30 nmol/L and 94 % had 25OHD < 50 nmol/L at trial enrolment. At delivery, mean CTx concentrations were 27 % lower in group E versus placebo (95 % CI: −38, −13; P < 0.001), adjusting for enrolment concentrations. However, at 6 months postpartum, CTx concentrations were not statistically different in group E versus placebo (14 %; 95 % CI: −5.3, 37; P = 0.168), adjusting for delivery CTx concentrations. Effects on other biomarkers at delivery or postpartum were not statistically significant. In conclusion, prenatal high-dose vitamin D supplementation reduced bone resorption during pregnancy, albeit by only one biomarker, and without evidence of a sustained effect in the postpartum period. However, further evidence is needed to substantiate potential maternal bone health benefits of vitamin D in the postpartum period.
