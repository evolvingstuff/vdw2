#### Vitamin D risk factors after Idiopathic Scoliosis surgery in adolescents - June 2024

 **Risk Factors of Vitamin D Deficiency Following Corrective Spinal Surgery in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: a narrative review**

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common rigid structural spinal deformity with unknown etiology. It has been associated with low bone mineral density and osteopenia. Vitamin D has an essential role in bone health and mineralization. So it is assumed that vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is associated with the onset and development of AIS. Risk factors of VDD in general population had been introduced and discussed widely but those involved in patients after corrective spinal surgery are debated. Here we review the most dominant risk factors associated with VDD in AIS patients following corrective spinal surgery. Preoperative VDD is probably the main risk factor of postoperative VDD. Female gender, eating disorders, dressing habits, physical inactivity, and increased bone turnover are the most important contributors of preoperative VDD. ICU admission, pain, medications, surgical complications, delirium, stress response, and bracing are probably the main risk factors of VDD postoperatively. The risk factor modifications and nutritional supplementation could profoundly impact surgical outcomes in this high-risk group of patients.

#### Prevalence of 25-OH-Vitamin D and Calcium Deficiency in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis - 2020

Several etiologies have been proposed as a basis and evolution theory for the development of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, but limited data were published until now that link vitamin D and calcium deficiency to this condition. The present study aims to evaluate the relationship between 25-OH-Vitamin D, total calcium, and the following data: Cobb angle, age, and patient sex. The seasonal variation for vitamin D will also be taken into consideration. A total of 101 patients with a mean age of 11.61 ± 2.33 years had vitamin D and calcium levels tested. The mean Cobb angle was 26.21o ± 12.37. The level of vitamin D was, on average, 24 ng/mL ± 9.64. Calcium values were within the normal range, with an average of 9.82 mg/dL ± 0.42. The male group showed lower levels of vitamin D compared to the female group (19.6 vs. 25.45 ng/mL) (p = 0.02). Seasonal variations showed significant differences for vitamin D (p=.0001). Vitamin D level was positively correlated with the calcium level (p=0.01, r=0.973), but also with the patient's age (p <0.001, r=0.158). 

The Cobb angle was negatively correlated with serum vitamin D levels (p<0.01, r=-0.472). Patients included in this study had low vitamin D levels, significant differences being observed between boys and girls, boys being more affected. The positive correlation between vitamin D and calcium, together with the negative correlation with the Cobb angle, is yet another proof that patients with idiopathic scoliosis should be investigated regularly for these pathologies.
