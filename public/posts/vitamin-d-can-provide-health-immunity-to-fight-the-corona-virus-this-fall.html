But instead of conducting an emotionally charged debate in which medical facts usually only play a subordinate role, it makes sense to take a sober look at the basics of immunology and the actual research situation.</span></p><img src=https://spitzen-praevention.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Vitamin-D-Corona-Nehls-Spitz-Herdengesundheit.jpg alt=image width=400><p>The Academy for Human Medicine has best-selling author, physician, and molecular geneticist <strong>Dr. medical Michael Nehls</strong> to do just that. What actually happens when corona viruses infect our body and what does the sun hormone vitamin D have to do with the performance of our immune system? Look forward to an informative conversation that provides facts and explains important basics in an understandable way!</p><h5 id=span-stylecolor-background-colorrgba2552552550herd-immunity-against-the-corona-virus-cannot-existspan><span style=color:;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)>Herd immunity against the corona virus cannot exist</span></h5><p><span style=color:;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)>The misconception that so-called herd immunity would pave the way out of the pandemic and that the corona virus would disappear as a result is quite widespread. Apart from the fact that various corona viruses have been with mankind for quite a long time and will continue to do so, this also applies to the well-known virus strain, which has been heating up tempers worldwide since the end of 2020: The specific RNA properties of the pathogen and its frequent mutations make herd immunity impossible.</span></p><p><span style=color:;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)>&ldquo;There can be no herd immunity against corona viruses, but there can be herd health,&rdquo; says Dr. medical Michael Nehls in a top-level discussion with Prof. Dr. medical Jorg Spitz.</span></p><h5 id=span-stylecolor-background-colorrgba2552552550herd-health-instead-of-herd-immunityspan><span style=color:;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)>Herd health instead of herd immunity</span></h5><p><span style=color:;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)>In any case, it is important to correctly assess the basic relationships:</span></p><p><span style=color:;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)>“For the vast majority of people, the corona virus is relatively harmless. Nevertheless, there are of course cases of severe courses or even death as a result of a corona infection.</span></p><p><span style=color:;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)>Nehls asked himself what connects these cases and what they have in common. Which factor ensures that our immune system functions adequately and can or cannot fight off a virus infection?</span></p><p><a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en-US&amp;u=https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Projekte_RKI/COVID-19_Todesfaelle.html">Data from the Robert Koch Institute</a> shows that as early as 2020, the probability of dying in winter as a result of a corona infection was about 76 times higher than in summer. The media and politicians are also currently warning of another fall wave. But how can this seasonality be explained?!!<span style=color:;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)>Less sun means less vitamin D - why our immune system is weakened in winter</span></p><p><span style=color:;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)>A very simple connection explains why severe courses, some of which have to be treated in intensive care units, and even deaths in connection with a corona infection occur much more frequently in winter than in summer: unless we actively raise our vitamin D levels with appropriate preparations , our body only produces the important hormone in sufficient quantities with the help of summer sunshine. In autumn and winter, the body&rsquo;s own vitamin D production is reduced and finally comes to a complete standstill. With sometimes serious effects on the performance of our immune system.</span></p><p>A corresponding correlation of the vitamin D level and the severity of the course of infection can be scientifically proven: If the vitamin D level is below 50 nmol/l, <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en-US&amp;u=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7717135">mortality in the event of a corona infection increases fourfold</a> , at values from less than 30 nmol/l by a factor <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en-US&amp;u=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7551780">of 18</a> ! At the same time, from a purely statistical point of view, from a vitamin D level of 125 nmol/l, practically no more corona-related deaths are to be expected, as <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en-US&amp;u=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC8541492">a corresponding meta-analysis</a> found.</p><h5 id=span-stylecolor-background-colorrgba2552552550correlation-vs-causality---how-can-these-connections-be-interpretedspan><span style=color:;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)>Correlation vs. causality - How can these connections be interpreted?</span></h5><p>All of these connections have been known for a long time and are sometimes <a href="https://spitzen%3C/strike%3Epraevention-com.translate.goog/2021/01/26/wendepunkt-im-mainstream-vitamin-d-und-covid-19-in-der-faz/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US">also dealt with in the wide-ranging press,</a> but mostly insufficiently and with wrong conclusions. After all, the correlation shown between vitamin D levels and the course of the disease would not be proof that the vitamin D factor really plays the decisive role. In principle, this argument is initially valid, but no longer if you take a closer look at further research results.</p><h5 id=span-stylecolor-background-colorrgba2552552550vitamin-d-protects-against-covid-19-scientific-studies-show-clear-causalityspan><span style=color:;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)>Vitamin D protects against COVID-19: Scientific studies show clear causality</span></h5><p><span style=color:;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)>If scientists want to find out whether there is a causality in addition to a correlation, the method of choice is the clinical intervention study: under otherwise identical conditions, some of the patients are given vitamin D, while others – the control group – are not. In this way it can be said whether the isolated factor makes a significant difference, or whether it is better to look for explanations elsewhere.</span></p><p><span style=color:;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)>Exactly these intervention studies have long been available in large numbers and show that vitamin D makes the decisive difference in the question of whether a corona infection is mild or severe, whether the result is a speedy recovery or whether an intensive care unit or even death is to be expected.</span></p><p>This was already proven in October 2020 by the so-called " <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en-US&amp;u=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7456194">Small Cordoba Study</a> &ldquo;. While there were no deaths in the vitamin D group, 8% of people in the control group died. The participants in the control group also required intensive care 25 times more often. Although critics noted here that the sample size of the study was too small for valid statements, <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en-US&amp;u=https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.08.20222638v2">mathematicians from the world&rsquo;s leading MIT were able to calculate</a> that the study with a p-value of &lt;0.000001 has a particularly high validity and provides significant results.

The overall result: Vitamin D has a particularly strong preventive effect to prevent infection, but is not an emergency &ldquo;drug&rdquo; that is only used first allowed if the infection has already occurred or is far advanced.

One of these reasons is the fact that there are also studies that come to completely different conclusions and claim to refute the above findings. However, if you take a closer look at this work, it becomes apparent that the sun hormone vitamin D was simply wrongly administered to the subjects - namely <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en-US&amp;u=https://c19vitamind.com/cannataandia.html">as a one-time high dose</a> in the late phase of the infection or the <a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en-US&amp;u=https://c19vitamind.com/walk.html">vitamin D levels were too low</a> .</p><p><span style=color:;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)>Although these isolated studies do not actually have any meaningfulness, the wide-ranging media show a special interest in them and so far mostly still prefer to falsely reflect the scientific state of affairs based on these works.</span></p><p>Prof. Dr. medical Joerg Spitz and Dr. Michael Nehls also deal with these questions and look back on two years of media blackout on the subject of vitamin D and COVID-19.

The SonnenAllianz website has great discussions on vitamin d and its critical co-factors: Mg, K2, Ca. The video and discussion from Dr. Michael Nehls is excellent.
