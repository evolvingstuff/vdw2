**It appears that ~10% of people will benefit from Topical more than the Oral form of Vitamin D** 

 **It appears that ~20% of people having specific health problems will get more benefit from Topical than Oral** 

* Preeclampsia. Food Allergy, PTSD, Ear infection, Infertility, MS, Colon Cancer, TB, Asthma, COPD, Epilepsy, Atrial Fibrillation. Liver

* Also suspect for those people with poor guts: Cystic Fibrosis, Diabetes

 **However, Topical forms of Vitamin D are:** 

*  **10X-100X more expensive** 

*  **Harder to use than oral for most people** 

*  **Do not easily allow high doses - for loading doses or non daily dosing (biweekly etc)** 

   * Vitamin D cream might be OK - 5 squirts of cream = 50,000 IU

 **Most body tissues can fully activate Vitamin D locally (without the Liver and Kidneys)** 

&nbsp; &nbsp; Tissues such as the skin, the inside of the [cheeks](/posts/vitamin-d-sprayed-inside-cheeks-buccal-spray-several-studies), the [lungs](/posts/inhaled-vitamin-d-help-lungs-many-studies), and the nose

 **Some people have a poor vitamin D binding gene** 

* Limits the amount of semi-activated Vitamin D from the liver

* The vitamin D binding gene does not appear to limit vitamin D that is activated by tissue

 **An increasing number of people have poor Vitamin D genes** 

* Starting in the 1930's people with poor immune systems have been surviving due to better hygiene, antibiotics, vaccines, etc.

* Since then, poor immune system genes have more frequently been passed on to future generations

* Before there was "Survival of the Fittest", but there is "Survival of the Survivors"

#### <span style="color:#F00;">4 Reasons why you have not heard that Vitamin D is good for the skin:</span>

 **<span style="color:#F00;">1) </span> Vitamin D has been patented to help the skin - and companies do not want to pay royalties** 

* [WO/2006/133829](http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?WO=2006133829&IA=EP2006005400&DISPLAY=CLAIMS) USE OF 25-HYDROXY-VITAMIN D3 -  **cream for many skin problems** 

* (WO/2006/094064) Sept 2006 METHOD OF REDUCING  **SCARS**  WITH VITAMIN D

* WO/2011/019617  VITAMIN D3 AND ANALOGS THEREOF FOR TREATING  **ALOPECIA**  - delivered to the skin March 2011

* [Who said vitamin D could not be patented](/posts/who-said-vitamin-d-could-not-be-patented) - VitaminDWiki

   *  **A patent is one of  the 22 [Criteria to associate a health problem with low vitamin D](/posts/criteria-to-associate-a-health-problem-with-low-vitamin-d) in VitaminDWiki** 

 **<span style="color:#F00;">2) </span> FDA requires a LOT of data to allow a claim that a supplement can improve health** 

It appears to cost >$30,000 to prepare, present, and defend a single health claim for a supplement

* [FDA allows the claim that Vitamin D “supports healthy pregnancies and promotes full-term births” – Oct 2019](/posts/fda-allows-the-claim-that-vitamin-d-supports-healthy-pregnancies-and-promotes-full-term-births)

* [FDA allows 2 specific Vitamin D and 2 Omega-3 health claims - 2019](/posts/fda-allows-2-specific-vitamin-d-and-2-omega-3-health-claims-2019)

 **<span style="color:#F00;">3) </span> Only recently have Vitamin D doses been large enough to really help (200X)** 

| | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | < year 2000 | 2019 | increase |
| Drops | 10 IU/drop | 2,000 IU | 200X |
| Capsule | 200 IU | 50,000 IU  | 250X |

 **<span style="color:#F00;">4) </span> Doctors rarely suggest applying the Vitamin D directly to the skin** 

They often incorrectly believe that the Vitamin D must be first processed by the liver and the kidneys
