 **Introduction:** Vitamin (vit) D deficiency is  prevalent amongst patients (pts) with colorectal and pancreatic cancers.  

Data for other GI malignancies are limited and the impact of  short-course oral vit D supplementation is unclear.

 **Methods:** An  IRB-approved retrospective review of 202 pts with GI cancers from  12/2007 to 9/2008 was done to evaluate the incidence of vitamin D  deficiency defined as serum 25-OH vit D levels of  <30 ng/ml  (severe <10 ng/ml; moderate=10-20 ng/ml; mild=21-30 ng/ml) and  incidence of 'low-normal' (31-50 ng/ml) and normal (>50 ng/ml) vit D  levels. Oral supplementation with vit D at 50,000 'u' weekly x 8-12  weeks were done and serum levels were redrawn at 2-3 months for pts with  low normal and deficient vit D, respectively.

 **Results:** 87.6% of  all 202 pts is vit D deficient (61% severe to moderate). (see Table). 92  pts were re-evaluated after 2-3 months of oral vit D supplementation.  Among this cohort, the incidence of pts with vitamin deficiency  decreased from 91.3% to 57.6% after first re-evaluation. Severe/moderate  deficiency rates also decreased from 71.7% to 13%. There were no  significant difference in response between males/females, age < or >65,  caucasian or non-caucasian or tumor type.

 **Conclusions:** Vitamin D  levels should routinely be evaluated for patients with GI maligancies.  Oral supplementation decreases the rate 'any' vit D deficiency from 91%  to 57%, and of 'severe to moderate' deficiency from 72% to 13%.  Prospective studies on the impact of vit D deficiency and  supplementation on various clinical outcomes among patients with GI  cancers would improve supportive care management of these patients.
