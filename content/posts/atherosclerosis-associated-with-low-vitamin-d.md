BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:

The purpose of this study was to assess the association of vitamin D deficiency and indices of mineral metabolism with subclinical carotid markers that predict cardiovascular events.

METHODS:

Two hundred three community-dwelling adults (Northern Manhattan Study; age,  **68** ±11; age range, 50 to 93 years) had serum measurements (calcium, phosphorus, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone) and carotid ultrasound (plaque presence, number, maximal carotid plaque thickness, intima-media thickness).

RESULTS:

Adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, plaque number was associated with phosphorus levels (?=0.39 per 1-mg/dL increase; P=0.02) and calcium-phosphorus product (?=0.36 per 10-U increase; P=0.03). 

In those with plaque (N=116 <span>[57%]</span>), the association of plaque number with phosphorus and calcium-phosphorus product persisted. 

In addition, 25-hydroxyvitamin D was inversely associated with both 

(intima-media thickness (?=-0.01 per 10-ng/mL increase; P=0.05) and 

* maximal carotid plaque thickness (?=-0.10 per 10-ng/mL increase; P=0.03). 

In a model containing traditional cardiac risk factors and indices of mineral metabolism, 25-hydroxyvitamin D  **accounted for 13% of the variance**  in both intima-media thickness and maximal carotid plaque thickness. 

Calcium, parathyroid hormone, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels were not associated with carotid measures.

CONCLUSIONS:

After adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors and renal function, serum phosphorus and calcium-phosphorus product were associated with a greater burden of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis.  **Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were associated with increased intima-media thickness and maximal carotid plaque thickness in those with plaque, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D contributed in a robust manner to the variance in both.** These results confirm and extend data on the association of low vitamin D levels with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis. The precise nature of this association and the optimum levels of vitamin D for vascular health remain to be elucidated.
