* Some studies have found that in increases LDL cholesterol by 25%

* " Daily doses of resveratrol in excess of a gram commonly cause mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, as well as “anal itchiness.”

* "Two studies, however, found that so-called “safe” levels of resveratrol (at 150 to 250 mg a day) may blunt some of the positive effects of exercise training"

Resveratrol is mainly found in grapes and red wine, also in some plants and fruits, such as peanuts, cranberries, pistachios, blueberries and bilberries. Moreover, nowadays this compound is available as purified preparation and dietary supplement. Resveratrol provides a wide range of benefits, including 

* cardiovascular protective, 

* antiplatelet, 

* antioxidant, 

* antiinflammatory, 

* blood glucose-lowering and 

* anticancer activities, 

hence it exhibits a complex mode of action. During the recent years, these properties have been widely studied in animal and human models, both in vitro and in vivo. This paper is intended to present information published during the recent years on the biological activities and multiple effects of resveratrol.

 **[Extensive overview](https://examine.com/supplements/resveratrol/)** 

* "The therapeutic dose of resveratrol ranges from 8.1 mg per day to 3,000 mg per day.  
Studies in humans suggest resveratrol can be supplemented at dosages up to 5 grams (5,000 mg) daily with few to no side effects outside of some intestinal upset and nausea."

#### Asked ChatGPT: What are the downsides to taking Resveratrol - Dec 2023

Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in certain plants and fruits, is often taken as a supplement for its potential health benefits. However, like any supplement, resveratrol can have downsides and side effects, particularly at higher doses or when taken in certain circumstances:

1.  **Gastrointestinal Issues** : High doses of resveratrol can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and other digestive issues. These effects are generally associated with doses higher than those achievable through diet alone, often occurring with supplement consumption   **[1](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/resveratrol-benefits#:~:text=Resveratrol%20has%20a%20fairly%20low,reached%20when%20you%20consume%20supplements) &nbsp;[2](https://www.livestrong.com/article/34699-negative-effects-resveratrol/#:~:text=Although%20rare%2C%20anecdotal%20gastrointestinal%20side,digestive%20side%20effects%20than%20others)** 

1.  **Drug Interactions** : Resveratrol may interact with several medications. It can inhibit cytochrome 3A4, potentially causing interactions with a range of medications including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (used to lower cholesterol), calcium channel agonists, anti-arrhythmic agents, HIV protease inhibitors, immunosuppressants, antihistamines, and erectile dysfunction medications. Additionally, its natural blood pressure-lowering and anti-coagulant effects might interact with blood pressure medications, anti-platelet drugs, anticoagulants, and NSAIDs like aspirin and ibuprofen  **[3](https://www.livestrong.com/article/34699-negative-effects-resveratrol/) &nbsp;[4](https://www.doctorshealthpress.com/resveratrol-side-effects-health-hazards/)** 

1.  **Estrogenic Effects** : Resveratrol has shown both estrogen agonist and antagonist effects in cell culture studies, and its chemical structure is similar to synthetic estrogen agonists. This characteristic can be problematic for individuals with estrogen-dependent tumors, such as those found in prostate and breast cancers. These tumors have many estrogen receptors and rely on the hormone for growth. Hence, individuals at risk for tumor growth should be cautious about concentrated resveratrol supplements  **[5](https://www.livestrong.com/article/34699-negative-effects-resveratrol/) &nbsp;[6](https://www.doctorshealthpress.com/resveratrol-side-effects-health-hazards/)** .

These symptoms are not universally experienced and may vary from person to person  **[9](https://www.doctorshealthpress.com/resveratrol-side-effects-health-hazards/)** .

It's important to note that while some of these side effects are more commonly reported, others are rare or based on anecdotal evidence. The overall safety and side effects can vary greatly depending on the individual, the dosage, and other factors such as concurrent medication use or existing health conditions. Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, including resveratrol, to ensure it is safe based on your personal health profile.
