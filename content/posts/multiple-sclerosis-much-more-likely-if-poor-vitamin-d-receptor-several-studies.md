Background

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in young adults. More than 50 genomic regions have been associated with MS susceptibility.

Due the important immune-modulating properties of Vitamin D, Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms – which interfere with the actions of Vitamin D- could be related to increased risk of MS.

Methods

We studied 120 patients fulfilling the McDonald criteria for MS (81 females and 39 males) and 180 healthy unrelated controls, nested in a case-Control study, and were recruited from the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Manuel Velasco Suárez in Mexico City. Genotyping of VDR gene polymorphisms BsmI (rs1544410) and TaqI (rs731236) was performed using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay which consists of a predesigned mix of unlabeled polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and the TaqMan minor groove binding group (MGB) probe (FAM dye-labeled).

Results

There was a statistically significant, positive association between MS and the T/T genotype of BsmI polymorphism ( **OR = 4.15** ; 95%CI 1.83–9.39), showing also a significant positive trend across genotypes (p < 0.01). 

This association was also present evaluating the recessive inheritance model of the polymorphism ( **OR = 3.91** ; 95%CI 1.77–8.64). When evaluating the association by alleles, the statistically significant positive association seen by genotypes was confirmed in the T allele carriers, showing an OR of 1.83 (95%CI 1.27–2.65) for MS.

Conclusions

We found a positive association of the genetic VDR polymorphisms TaqI (rs731236) and BsmI (rs1544410), with the risk of MS in a sample of Mexican adults.

Background

Previous studies have reported vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms in multiple sclerosis (MS); however, the results remain contradictory. This study aimed to investigate the association between VDR polymorphisms and the risk of MS.

Methods

PubMed and Embase databases were searched to obtain eligible studies. Data were calculated by odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results

Twenty seven case–control studies with 4879 MS patients and 5402 controls were included. There was no significant association between ApaI polymorphisms and MS in the overall population. In Asians, no association was found between ApaI polymorphism and MS in the recessive, dominant, Codominant (OR1), Codominant (OR2), Codominant (OR3) models and allele contrast. Similar results were obtained between BsmI polymorphisms and MS. The association between TaqI polymorphism and MS showed significance in the recessive, homozygous, codominant (OR3) models in the overall population and Caucasians. The dominant model showed no association of Taq I polymorphism with MS risk in HLA-DRB1*15-positive and HLA-DRB1*15-negative groups. FokI polymorphism with MS was found in Codominant (OR3) model in the overall population. In Asians, FokI polymorphism showed association with MS in recessive, dominant, Codominant (OR1), Codominant (OR3) models and allele contrast. Subgroup analysis of sex showed no associations between TaqI or FokI polymorphism and MS risk in males or females in all models or allele contrast.

Conclusions

The VDR TaqI polymorphisms showed association with MS risk, especially in Caucasians.

In Asians, ApaI and FokI polymorphisms correlated with MS risk, while BsmI polymorphisms showed no association with MS.
