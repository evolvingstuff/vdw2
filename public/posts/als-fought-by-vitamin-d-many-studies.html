Prognosis is highly variable, ranging from a few months to more than 30 years. 25OH vitamin D (25OH VD) blood levels have been associated with a worse prognosis of ALS, but these results remain in dispute. We addressed this controversy with a prospective study and multivariate analysis to study the influence of known clinical prognostic factors of the disease and 25OH VD levels on Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) severity score (ALS-SS), as defined by the monthly rate of decline of ALSFRS-R score, to identify the factors most closely linked to the risk of worsening of the disease.</p><p>Results: This prospective cohort of ALS patients recruited 127 individuals, and 105 of them met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of onset was 62.2 ± 12.1 years, 32% of subjects had bulbar onset, and the gender ratio was 1.44 (male/female). Mean 25OH VD level was 26.8 ± 10.8 ng/ml and was similar between males and females.</p><p>Patients with 25OH VD levels &lt;15 ng/ml had significantly higher ALS-SS at inclusion (ALS-SSi) than those with normal levels (>30 ng/ml), p = 0.011. The study of ALS-SS as calculated at the end of follow-up (ALS-SSe) was not found to correlate to initial 25OH VD levels (r = −0.19; p = 0.084). Univariate analysis showed that ALS-SSe correlated with 25OH VD levels, ALS duration at inclusion, slow vital capacity (SVC) at inclusion, and SVC loss. The multivariate model showed that 25OH VD levels were independently associated with ALS-SSe: r = −0.0125, p = 0.033. Log-rank test with Kaplan–Meier curves did not show significant differences in survival between the groups defined by 25OH VD levels: &lt;15, >15 and &lt;30, and > 30 ng/ml, p = 0.88.</p><p>Conclusions: This prospective study in ALS patients confirmed previous retrospective results: ALS-SSi is significantly higher in patients with severe VD deficiency. For the first time, multivariate analysis showed that 25OH VD level was an independent prognostic factor correlated to ALS-SSe, suggesting that discrepancies between previous works could be due to confounders. It would be important that the present work be replicated in larger samples to confirm the present findings.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/als-may-2020.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-and-als-genetics-and-signaling--2013>Vitamin D and ALS: genetics and Signaling - 2013</h4><p><strong>Roles of vitamin D in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: possible genetic and cellular signaling mechanisms</strong></p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/als-2013.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/als-2013.jpg alt=image><hr><h4 id=als-4x-worse-if-severely-low-vitamin-d---nov2013>ALS 4X worse if severely low Vitamin D - Nov 2013</h4><p><a href=/posts/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-has-4x-faster-decline-if-severely-low-vitamin-d style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has 4X faster decline if severely low Vitamin D – Nov 2013">Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has 4X faster decline if severely low Vitamin D – Nov 2013</a> has the following chart.</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/als-2014.jpg alt=image width=800><p><strong>Red line: &lt; 25 nmol = &lt;10 ng</strong></p><hr><h4 id=even-2000-iu-helped-all-20-als-patients-in-the-clinical-trial---in-2013>Even 2,000 IU helped all 20 ALS patients in the clinical trial - in 2013</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D deficiency and its supplementation in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</strong></p><p>J Clin Neurosci. 2013 Jun 28. pii: S0967-5868(13)00149-5. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2013.01.011.>doi: 10.1016/j.jocn.2013.01.011.</a></p><p>Karam C, Barrett MJ, Imperato T, Macgowan DJ, Scelsa S.</p><p>Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.

Vitamin D levels were checked in 37 consecutive patients with ALS. Demographic data, vitamin D supplementation, change in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) score, and side effects from vitamin D were noted over a 9-month follow-up period. ALSFRS-R scores were compared between patients who took vitamin D and those who did not. The median age was 55 years, and the median time since symptom onset was 61 months. The mean vitamin D level was 22.3ng/mL (normal range, 30-80ng/mL). Eighty-one percent of patients had a vitamin D level lower than 30ng/mL, and 43% had a vitamin D level lower than 20ng/mL.</p><p>Twenty patients took <strong>2000 international units of vitamin D daily</strong> . After adjustment for age and baseline vitamin D levels in a linear regression model, the ALSFRS-R score decline was smaller in patients taking vitamin D at 9 months (p=0.02) but was not significantly different at 3 or 6 months. Median vitamin D levels rose from 18.5 to 31.0ng/mL at 6 months in the group taking vitamin D. No side effects secondary to vitamin D supplementation were reported. Vitamin D supplementation at 2000 international units daily was safe over a period of 9 months and may have a beneficial effect on ALSFRS-R scores. Further studies are warranted to determine whether there is a benefit in vitamin D supplementation for all ALS patients.</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/als-2000-red.jpg alt=image><p>Fig. 1.

A better understanding of the role of vitamin D in ALS is needed to determine whether trials of systematic supplementation are justified. Our aim was to report vitamin D levels during the course of ALS and to evaluate its relationship with clinical parameters at diagnosis and with disease progression.</p><p>METHODS: We prospectively collected vitamin D serum concentrations from 125 consecutive ALS patients. Cox proportional hazard models analyzed the relationship between vitamin D concentrations, clinical parameters, and survival.</p><p>RESULTS: The mean vitamin D concentration was below our laboratory&rsquo;s lower limit of normal (P &lt; 0.0001) and did not change during the course of the disease. The concentrations were higher in patients with bulbar onset (P = 0.003) and were negatively associated with body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.0095). <strong>Models with ALSFRS-R (ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised) and BMI as covariates showed that vitamin D concentrations predicted a worse prognosis.</strong></p><p>CONCLUSION: .Our cohort&rsquo;s distribution of vitamin D concentrations was consistent with previous reports. <strong>Surprisingly, we noted a negative effect of higher vitamin D levels on prognosis in ALS</strong> .

The aims of this study were to retrospectively compare vitamin D blood levels in ALS patients with those in healthy subjects, correlate vitamin D blood levels with clinical functions in patients, and evaluate whether vitamin D administration could modify the disease&rsquo;s clinical progression. Vitamin D blood levels were evaluated in 57ALS patients and in 57 healthy subjects. In the ALS patients, the following clinical variables were evaluated every 3 months: Medical Research Council scale (MRC) score, revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) score and forced vital capacity (FVC). Twenty-four patients were treated with high doses of cholecalciferol. No significant differences were found between the vitamin D blood levels in the ALS patients (18.8 ± 12.2) and the healthy subjects (20.7 ± 10.1). The vitamin D levels in ALS patients did not correlate with recorded clinical parameters. No clinical differences in terms of ALSFRS-R, MRC, or FVC were found between the treated and the untreated patients over time. In ALS, as in other chronic neurological diseases, vitamin D levels in blood appeared reduced, but no difference was found between the levels in ALS patients and healthy subjects. Oral vitamin D supplementation in ALS patients was not associated with a better prognosis than in untreated ALS patients.

However, they do share several similarities:</p></li><li><p>Neuromuscular Disorders: Both ALS and MD are classified as neuromuscular disorders. This means that they both affect the muscles and the nerves that control them.</p></li><li><p>Progressive Disease: ALS and MD are progressive diseases, meaning symptoms tend to worsen over time. In both cases, this progression increases muscle weakness and functional disability.</p></li><li><p>Genetic Factors: Some forms of both ALS and MD can be caused by inherited genetic mutations. However, not all cases are inherited; most ALS cases are sporadic, meaning they occur randomly without a clear cause.</p></li><li><p>Muscle Weakness: Both diseases lead to muscle weakness, though the progression, distribution, and specific muscles affected can vary. In ALS, muscle weakness often starts in the limbs, while Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (the most common form of MD in children) usually begins in the hips and pelvis.</p></li><li><p>No Known Cure: As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there are no known cures for either ALS or MD. Managing both diseases involves treating symptoms, preventing complications, and maintaining the quality of life as much as possible.</p></li><li><p>Life Expectancy: Both diseases can impact life expectancy, though the degree can vary widely. ALS often progresses more rapidly than most forms of MD, leading to life-threatening complications more quickly.</p></li><li><p>Research: Both diseases are the focus of intense research efforts aimed at better understanding their causes, finding more effective treatments, and, ultimately, discovering a cure.</p></li></ol><ul><li>Despite these commonalities, it&rsquo;s important to note that ALS and MD are distinct diseases with different causes and disease processes. If you or someone else has been diagnosed with either condition, it&rsquo;s crucial to speak with a healthcare provider to understand the specific disease and its management.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>See also in VitaminDWiki</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/muscular-dystrophy-probably-treated-by-high-dose-vitamin-d-plus-muscle-rehab style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Muscular Dystrophy probably treated by high-dose Vitamin D plus muscle rehab">Muscular Dystrophy probably treated by high-dose Vitamin D plus muscle rehab</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/muscular-dystrophies-low-vitamin-d-might-be-associated-with-all-9-types style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Muscular Dystrophies – low vitamin D might be associated with all 9 types – Aug 2018">Muscular Dystrophies – low vitamin D might be associated with all 9 types – Aug 2018</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/muscles-and-vitamin-d-many-studies style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Muscles and Vitamin D - many studies">Muscles and Vitamin D - many studies</a></p></li></ul></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1749769999"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1749769999",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1749769999"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1749769999"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1749769999"></script></body></html>
