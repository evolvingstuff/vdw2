 **Highlights** 

* Developmental Vitamin D deficiency alters placental inflammatory response.

* Developmental Vitamin D deficient placentas containing a male foetus are selectively vulnerable to exposure to viral particles.

* Variability in placental inflammatory response may inform future mechanisms for the links between DVD-deficiency and autism and the extreme male brain theories of autism.

Emerging evidence suggests that maternal or  **developmental vitamin D (DVD)**  deficiency is a risk factor for Autism Spectrum Disorders. A well-established association has also been found between gestational infection and increased incidence of autism. 

Placenta mediates the maternal immune response in respect to the foetus. 

The placenta is also a major source of vitamin D and locally produced vitamin D is an essential regulator of immune function during pregnancy. 

Here we investigate the effects of DVD-deficiency on baseline placental immune status and in response to the well-known viral and bacterial immune activating agents polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 

We show DVD-deficiency does not affect baseline inflammatory cytokines in placenta. However, when challenged with poly(I:C) but not LPS, DVD-deficient placentas from male foetuses had higher production of IL-6 and 1L-1β compared to control placentas. This suggests the developing DVD-deficient male foetus may be particularly vulnerable to maternal viral exposures. 

This in turn may have adverse implications for the developing male brain. In conclusion, a dysregulated placental immune response may provide a plausible mechanism for both the epidemiological links between DVD-deficiency and increased male incidence of developmental conditions such as autism.
