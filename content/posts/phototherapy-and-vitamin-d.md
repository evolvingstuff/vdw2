The skin is the site for the photosynthesis of vitamin D and is a target tissue for the active metabolite of vitamin D. An increasing body of evidence indicates that vitamin D produced during phototherapy may be responsible for the positive effects observed during treatment of some skin diseases. Topical or oral application of vitamin D derivatives are used alone or with phototherapy. This paper reviews what is known about the use of phototherapy to enhance vitamin D levels, the use of vitamin D analogues with phototherapy, the efficacy of combination therapies, and controversies regarding some of the outcomes. Vitamin D can play a beneficial role in treating psoriasis, even though the exact role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis and severity of psoriasis remains unclear. The role of vitamin D in vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, polymorphic light eruption, and mycosis fungoides must be further investigated.
