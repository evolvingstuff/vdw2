#### Some people want to speed up the restoration of nutrient levels

*  **The body often does not benefit from a nutrient until an adequate level is restored** 

*  **Sometimes a person wants to experience the benefits months sooner** 

>  **Get quick positive feedback about taking a nutrient** 

>  **Want to treat an ailment** 

>  **Have an upcoming need for the nutrient** 

   *  **pregnancy** 

   *  **surgery** 

   *  **will be playing a contact sport and want to reduce possibility of concussion** 

*  **Over a million people have had loading doses of vitamin D, which reduces the time to get a good level of vitamin D by 2 - 10 months** 

*  **There is far less history for Omega-3 loading doses , but it appears that 1 - 3 months can be saved**
