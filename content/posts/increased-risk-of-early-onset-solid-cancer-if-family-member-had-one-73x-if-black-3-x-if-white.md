#### Increased burden of familial-associated early-onset cancer risk among minority Americans compared to non-Latino Whites.

Elife, 22 Jun 2021, [https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.64793](https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.64793)

Background

The role of race/ethnicity in genetic predisposition of early-onset cancers can be estimated by comparing family-based cancer concordance rates among ethnic groups.

Methods

We used linked California health registries to evaluate the relative cancer risks for first-degree relatives of patients diagnosed between ages 0 and 26, and the relative risks of developing distinct  **second primary malignancies (SPMs)** . From 1989 to 2015, we identified 29,631 cancer patients and 62,863 healthy family members. We calculated the  **standardized incident ratios (SIRs)**  of early-onset primary cancers diagnosed in proband siblings and mothers, as well as SPMs detected among early-onset patients. Analyses were stratified by self-identified race/ethnicity.

Results

Given probands with cancer, there were increased relative risks of any cancer for siblings and mothers (SIR = 3.32; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>: 2.85-3.85) and of SPMs (SIR = 7.27; 95% CI: 6.56-8.03). 

Given a proband with solid cancer, both 

* Latinos (SIR = 4.98; 95% CI: 3.82-6.39) and 

* non-Latino Blacks (SIR = 7.35; 95% CI: 3.36-13.95) 

exhibited significantly higher relative risk of any cancer in siblings and mothers when compared to 

* non-Latino White subjects (SIR = 3.02; 95% CI: 2.12-4.16). 

For hematologic cancers, higher familial risk was evident for Asian/Pacific Islanders (SIR = 7.56; 95% CI: 3.26-14.90) compared to non-Latino whites (SIR = 2.69; 95% CI: 1.62-4.20).

Conclusions

The data support a need for increased attention to the genetics of early-onset cancer predisposition and environmental factors in race/ethnic minority families in the United States.
