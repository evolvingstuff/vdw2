Context: We wanted to investigate vitamin D in low-risk prostate cancer.

Objectives: The objective of the study was to determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation at 4000 IU/d for 1 yr is safe and would result in a decrease in serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or in the rate of progression.

Design: In this open-label clinical trial (Investigational New Drug 77,839), subjects were followed up until repeat biopsy.

Setting: All subjects were enrolled through the Medical University of South Carolina and the Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Affairs Medical Center, both in Charleston, SC.

Patients and Other Participants: All subjects had a diagnosis of low-risk prostate cancer. 

Fifty-two subjects were enrolled in the study, 48 completed 1 yr of supplementation, and 44 could be analyzed for both safety and efficacy objectives.

Intervention: The intervention included vitamin D3 soft gels (4000 IU).

Main Outcome Measures: Adverse events were monitored throughout the study. PSA serum levels were measured at entry and every 2 months for 1 yr. 

Biopsy procedures were performed before enrollment (for eligibility) and after 1 yr of supplementation.

Results: No adverse events associated with vitamin D3 supplementation were observed. 

No significant changes in PSA levels were observed. 

However, 

* 24 of 44 subjects (55%) showed a  **decrease** in the number of positive cores or decrease in Gleason score; 

* five subjects (11%) showed  **no change** ; 

* 15 subjects (34%) showed an **increase in the number of positive cores or Gleason score** .

Conclusion:  **Patients with low-risk prostate cancer under active surveillance may benefit from vitamin D3 supplementation at 4000 IU/d.**

FIG. 4. Trajectories of number of positive cores over time in subjects supplemented with vitamin D3

(A) and untreated historical control subjects (B). A and B,Gray lines represent

individual patient data, and thick solid black lines are the fitted estimate including all data

within 48 months of baseline. The gray circles at the ends of some of thegray lines refer to

subjects with an increase of Gleason score at repeat biopsy or a decrease of Gleason score

from baseline. A, The thick solid black lines are the fitted estimates including all data for 24-,

36-, and 48-month follow-up period, respectively. The slopes are identical between the

24- and 48-month time thresholds (b0.0146), whereas the slope of the 36-month

threshold is slightly flatter (0.0125). All corresponding P values are significant: 0.0090 (24

months); 0.0098 (36 months); 0.00093 (48 months). B, The slope is not significantly different

from 0 (P0.17). However, the slopes in A and B (based on all follow-up data) are

significantly different from each other (P0.002).

Context: We wanted to investigate vitamin D in low-risk prostate cancer.

Objectives: The objective of the study was to determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation at 4000 IU/d for 1 yr is safe and would result in a decrease in serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or in the rate of progression.

Design: In this open-label clinical trial (Investigational New Drug 77,839), subjects were followed up until repeat biopsy.

Setting: All subjects were enrolled through the Medical University of South Carolina and the Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Affairs Medical Center, both in Charleston, SC.

Patients and Other Participants: All subjects had a diagnosis of low-risk prostate cancer. 
Fifty-two subjects were enrolled in the study, 48 completed 1 yr of supplementation, and 44 could be analyzed for both safety and efficacy objectives.

Intervention: The intervention included vitamin D3 soft gels (4000 IU).

Main Outcome Measures: Adverse events were monitored throughout the study. PSA serum levels were measured at entry and every 2 months for 1 yr. 
Biopsy procedures were performed before enrollment (for eligibility) and after 1 yr of supplementation.

Results: No adverse events associated with vitamin D3 supplementation were observed. 
No significant changes in PSA levels were observed. 
However, 
*24 of 44 subjects (55%) showed a __decrease __in the number of positive cores or decrease in Gleason score; 
*five subjects (11%) showed __no change__; 
*15 subjects (34%) showed an__ increase in the number of positive cores or Gleason score__.
Conclusion: __Patients with low-risk prostate cancer under active surveillance may benefit from vitamin D3 supplementation at 4000 IU/d.__

FIG. 4. Trajectories of number of positive cores over time in subjects supplemented with vitamin D3
(A) and untreated historical control subjects (B). A and B,Gray lines represent
individual patient data, and thick solid black lines are the fitted estimate including all data
within 48 months of baseline. The gray circles at the ends of some of thegray lines refer to
subjects with an increase of Gleason score at repeat biopsy or a decrease of Gleason score
from baseline. A, The thick solid black lines are the fitted estimates including all data for 24-,
36-, and 48-month follow-up period, respectively. The slopes are identical between the
24- and 48-month time thresholds (b0.0146), whereas the slope of the 36-month
threshold is slightly flatter (0.0125). All corresponding P values are significant: 0.0090 (24
months); 0.0098 (36 months); 0.00093 (48 months). B, The slope is not significantly different
from 0 (P0.17). However, the slopes in A and B (based on all follow-up data) are
significantly different from each other (P0.002).
