#### Optimized Vitamin D Repletion in Refractory Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplant with Oral Thin Film Cholecalciferol

Vitamin D deficiency is common in childhood, pervasive before and after bone marrow transplant, and associated with increased incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and decreased survival in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Numerous barriers impede replacement, including malabsorption secondary to gut GVHD, mucositis, inability to take capsules, kidney disease, liver disease, and infection; many patients remain refractory despite vitamin D therapy. We hypothesized that a different formulation of cholecalciferol, administered on the tongue as a readily dissolving oral thin film (OTF), would ease administration and facilitate therapeutic vitamin D levels (>35 ng/mL) in refractory patients. In this prospective pilot study, we evaluated 20 patients post-HSCT (range: day +21 - day +428 at enrollment) with serum vitamin D levels </=35 ng/mL. Cholecalciferol OTF strips (CURE Pharmaceutical) were administered for twelve weeks. Dosing was based on patient size and titrated according to individual pharmacokinetics. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test demonstrated marked improvement in all 20 formerly refractory patients, increasing from a median baseline vitamin D of 29.2 ng/mL to 58 ng/mL at end of study (p<0.0001). All patients demonstrated improvement in serum vitamin D level by week 4 on study, some of whom had been refractory for years prior. Median dose was 1 OTF strip (40,000 IU) per week. No toxicity was observed. This formulation proved to be safe, effective, efficient, and well-received. We are eager to explore other patient populations which might benefit from this promising development, and other therapeutics which might be optimized by this mode of delivery.

Vitamin D deficiency is common in childhood, pervasive before and after bone marrow transplant, and associated with increased incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and decreased survival in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Numerous barriers impede replacement, including malabsorption secondary to gut GVHD, mucositis, inability to take capsules, kidney disease, liver disease, and infection; many patients remain refractory despite vitamin D therapy. We hypothesized that a different formulation of cholecalciferol, administered on the tongue as a readily dissolving oral thin film (OTF), would ease administration and facilitate therapeutic vitamin D levels (&gt;35 ng/mL) in refractory patients. In this prospective pilot study, we evaluated 20 patients post-HSCT (range: day +21 - day +428 at enrollment) with serum vitamin D levels &lt;/=35 ng/mL. Cholecalciferol OTF strips (CURE Pharmaceutical) were administered for twelve weeks. Dosing was based on patient size and titrated according to individual pharmacokinetics. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test demonstrated marked improvement in all 20 formerly refractory patients, increasing from a median baseline vitamin D of 29.2 ng/mL to 58 ng/mL at end of study (p&lt;0.0001). All patients demonstrated improvement in serum vitamin D level by week 4 on study, some of whom had been refractory for years prior. Median dose was 1 OTF strip (40,000 IU) per week. No toxicity was observed. This formulation proved to be safe, effective, efficient, and well-received. We are eager to explore other patient populations which might benefit from this promising development, and other therapeutics which might be optimized by this mode of delivery.
