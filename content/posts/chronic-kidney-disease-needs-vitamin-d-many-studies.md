#### Vitamin D therapy in chronic kidney disease: a critical appraisal of clinical trial evidence - Aug 2024

In people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the physiology of vitamin D is altered and leads to abnormalities in bone and mineral metabolism which contribute to CKD mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). Observational studies show an association between vitamin D deficiency and increased risk of mortality, cardiovascular disease and fracture in CKD. Although vitamin D therapy is widely prescribed in people with CKD, clinical trials to date have failed to demonstrate a clear benefit of either nutritional vitamin D supplementation or active vitamin D therapy in improving clinical outcomes in CKD. This review provides an updated critical analysis of recent trial evidence on vitamin D therapy in people with CKD.

#### Vitamin D and Chronic Kidney Disease Association with Mineral and Bone Disorder: An Appraisal of Tangled Guidelines

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a highly prevalent condition worldwide in which the kidneys lose many abilities, such as the regulation of vitamin D (VD) metabolism. Moreover, people with CKD are at a higher risk of multifactorial VD deficiency, which has been extensively associated with poor outcomes, including bone disease, cardiovascular disease, and higher mortality. Evidence is abundant in terms of the association of negative outcomes with low levels of VD, but recent studies have lowered previous high expectations regarding the beneficial effects of VD supplementation in the general population. Although controversies still exist, the diagnosis and treatment of VD have not been excluded from nephrology guidelines, and much data still supports VD supplementation in CKD patients. In this narrative review, we briefly summarize evolving controversies and useful clinical approaches, underscoring that the adverse effects of VD derivatives must be balanced against the need for effective prevention of progressive and severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. Guidelines vary, but there seems to be general agreement that VD deficiency should be avoided in CKD patients, and it is likely that one should not wait until severe SHPT is present before cautiously starting VD derivatives. Furthermore, it is emphasized that the goal should not be the complete normalization of parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. New developments may help us to better define optimal VD and PTH at different CKD stages, but large trials are still needed to confirm that VD and precise control of these and other CKD-MBD biomarkers are unequivocally related to improved hard outcomes in this population,

#### CKD not helped by small doses of standard Vitamin D - Aug 2023

 **Vitamin D supplementation in people with CKD** 

Kidney Int . 2023 Aug 2;S0085-2538(23)00540-9. [doi: 10.1016/j.kint.2023.07.010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2023.07.010)

Vitamin D supplements have long been advocated for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on data from observational studies among the general population and also people with CKD. These data consistently suggested that higher circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are associated with improved fracture, cardiovascular, cancer, and mortality outcomes. In the last few years, large clinical trials have been conducted to assess the effects of vitamin D supplements on a range of clinically relevant outcomes. Most of these studies were performed in the general population but also enrolled people with CKD. Virtually all these trials were negative and contradicted the observational data. In this review, the key observational data and clinical trials are summarized and potential explanations for the discrepancies between these studies are discussed.
