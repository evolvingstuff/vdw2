Background

Vitamin D plays an essential role in immune responses to infections. However, the association between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and respiratory infection remains unclear.

Objectives

The current study aimed to examine the association between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and respiratory infection among the United States adults.

Methods

This cross-sectional study used data from the NHANES 2001–2014. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and were classified as ≥75.0 nmol/L (sufficiency), 50.0–74.9 nmol/L (insufficiency), 30.0–49.9 nmol/L (moderate deficiency), and <30 nmol/L (severe deficiency). The respiratory infections included self-reported head or chest cold as well as influenza, pneumonia, or ear infection within the last 30 d. The associations between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and respiratory infections were examined using weighted logistic regression models. Data are presented as ORs and 95% CIs.

Results

This study included 31,466 United States adults ≥20 y of age (47.1 y, 55.5% women) with a mean serum 25(OH)D concentration of 66.2 nmol/L. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, season of examination, lifestyle and dietary factors, and body mass index, compared with participants with a serum 25(OH)D concentration ≥75.0 nmol/L, those with a serum 25(OH)D concentration <30 nmol/L had higher risk of head or chest cold (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.36) and other respiratory diseases, including influenza, pneumonia, and ear infections (OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.35, 2.51). In the stratification analyses, lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with a higher risk of head or chest cold in obese adults but not in nonobese adults.

Conclusions

Serum 25(OH)D concentrations are inversely associated with respiratory infection occurrence among United States adults. This finding may shed light on the protective effect of vitamin D on the respiratory health.

Background
Vitamin D plays an essential role in immune responses to infections. However, the association between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and respiratory infection remains unclear.

Objectives
The current study aimed to examine the association between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and respiratory infection among the United States adults.

Methods
This cross-sectional study used data from the NHANES 2001–2014. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and were classified as ≥75.0 nmol/L (sufficiency), 50.0–74.9 nmol/L (insufficiency), 30.0–49.9 nmol/L (moderate deficiency), and &lt;30 nmol/L (severe deficiency). The respiratory infections included self-reported head or chest cold as well as influenza, pneumonia, or ear infection within the last 30 d. The associations between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and respiratory infections were examined using weighted logistic regression models. Data are presented as ORs and 95% CIs.

Results
This study included 31,466 United States adults ≥20 y of age (47.1 y, 55.5% women) with a mean serum 25(OH)D concentration of 66.2 nmol/L. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, season of examination, lifestyle and dietary factors, and body mass index, compared with participants with a serum 25(OH)D concentration ≥75.0 nmol/L, those with a serum 25(OH)D concentration &lt;30 nmol/L had higher risk of head or chest cold (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.36) and other respiratory diseases, including influenza, pneumonia, and ear infections (OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.35, 2.51). In the stratification analyses, lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with a higher risk of head or chest cold in obese adults but not in nonobese adults.

Conclusions
Serum 25(OH)D concentrations are inversely associated with respiratory infection occurrence among United States adults. This finding may shed light on the protective effect of vitamin D on the respiratory health.
