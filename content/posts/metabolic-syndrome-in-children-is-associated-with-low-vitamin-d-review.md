The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and cardiometabolic risk in children and the effect of vitamin D supplementation on risk. 

We included  **35**  clinical trials, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, and cohort studies that evaluated the relationship between 25OHD and 

* blood pressure, 

* lipid levels, 

* insulin/glucose metabolism, 

* endothelial dysfunction, and 

* arterial stiffness. 

One randomized clinical trial that randomized adolescents to 2000 or 400 IU/d of vitamin D and found improvement in  **arterial stiffness**  in the high-dose group and worsening in the low-dose group. 

One cross-sectional study found no relationship between 25OHD and endothelial dysfunction. 

Of 12 cross-sectional studies, 

* 10 found an inverse association between 25OHD and  **systolic blood pressure** , although 

* 2 trials found no relationship. 

There was no consistent association between 25OHD and lipid levels or insulin/glucose metabolism. Insufficient evidence was available to conclude that vitamin D supplementation yields cardiometabolic benefit.
