#### Asthma exacerbations in children decrease by 60 percent with vitamin D supplementation – meta-analysis – 2015

#### 1.7X increased risk of Asthma if low vitamin D - April 2015

 **Association between vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency and the risk of childhood asthma: evidence from a meta-analysis.**

OBJECTIVE: Whether vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are associated with childhood asthma remains unclear. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to summarize the evidence from epidemiological studies of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency and the risk of childhood asthma.

METHODS: Pertinent studies were identified by searching of PubMed and Web of Knowledge. The random effect model was used to combine the results. Meta-regression and subgroups analyses were used to explore potential sources of between-study heterogeneity. Publication bias was estimated using Egger's regression asymmetry test.

RESULTS: Finally, 14 articles with 15 studies including 3424 cases for vitamin D deficiency and 9 articles with 10 studies including 2756 cases for vitamin D insufficiency were included in this meta-analysis. The relative risk (95% confidence interval) of childhood asthma risk for vitamin D deficiency was  **1.684**  (1.321-2.148), and the associations were significant in America and Europe. Significant association of childhood asthma between vitamin D insufficiency and childhood asthma risk was found overall <span>[1.577 (1.230-2.023)]</span> and the subgroups of America, Europe and Asia. No evidence of significant publication bias between vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency and childhood asthma risk were found.

CONCLUSIONS: Results from this meta-analysis suggested that vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency might increase the risk of childhood asthma.

#### 60% Asthma reduction if take 500 - 2000 IU of vitamin D daily - Nov 2014

 **Efficacy of high-dose vitamin D in pediatric asthma: A systematic review and meta-analysis**

Context: Observational studies have suggested a relationship between vitamin D status and asthma-related respiratory outcomes. The benefit of vitamin D supplementation for pulmonary function, symptoms and exacerbations is not well established. 

Objective: To systematically review paediatric clinical trials investigating the role of vitamin D on asthma-related respiratory outcomes. 

Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL were searched January 2014. No date or language restrictions. Study selection: Clinical trials reporting asthma-related respiratory outcomes following vitamin D administration at a dose equal or greater than 500 IU per day were included and reviewed independently by two authors for full systematic review eligibility. 

Data extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted and verified predefined data fields. 

Results: We identified five studies that met study eligibility and assessed final data synthesis. 

The median trial size was 48 participants (range 17-430) and the average  **daily dose of cholecalciferol ranged from 500 to 2,000 IU/day.** 

Overall study methodological quality was high, but some heterogeneity in population and vitamin D dosing regimen was evident. 

Meta-analysis suggested a statistically significant reduction ( **RR 0.41** , CI 0.27 to 0.63) in asthma exacerbation with vitamin D therapy. 

Limitations: Due to variability in outcome selection and missing data, it was not possible to perform meta-analysis for pulmonary function testing and asthma symptom scores. Vitamin D-related adverse events were not considered in four of five papers. 

Conclusions: Available evidence from this systematic review suggests that high dose vitamin D may prevent asthma exacerbation. This should be confirmed through larger well-designed randomized controlled trials.
