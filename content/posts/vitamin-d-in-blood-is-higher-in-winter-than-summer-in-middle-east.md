Purpose:? Seasonal variations in circulating vitamin D levels provide vital information as to the most appropriate time to either start or increase vitamin D supplementation in order to maintain optimal vitamin D levels. In this follow-up study we determined seasonal differences in serum 25(OH)-vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, as well as parallel changes in metabolic parameters, in a cohort of adult overweight and obese Saudis.

Methods:? 121 adult, overweight and obese, consenting Saudis aged 18-70 years were randomly recruited from 4 Primary Health Care Centers (PHCCs) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. They were divided according to the season when baseline measurements were made <span>[74 Summer (April-October); 47 Winter (November-March)]</span>. Anthropometrics were obtained and fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and every 3 months for 1 year. Fasting blood glucose, corrected calcium levels and lipid profiles were measured routinely. Serum 25(OH)-vitamin D was quantified using a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Results:? Age- and BMI-matched mean 25(OH)-vitamin D levels from the winter group were significantly higher than those of the summer group (p < 0.001). In both groups, HDL-C levels improved significantly as 25(OH)-vitamin D levels increased with subsequent follow-ups, even after adjusting for age, gender and BMI (p < 0.001).

Conclusion:? Seasonal differences in serum 25(OH)-vitamin D levels in Saudi Arabia are counterintuitive, with circulating levels being higher during the winter than the summer season. Increased vitamin D supplementation is thus recommended to maintain optimal serum 25(OH)-vitamin D levels during the summer season.
