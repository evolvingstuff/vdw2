* "Consider: A report earlier this year shows that roughly three-quarters of cardiology fellows in the U.S. received payments from medical drug and device companies in the year before graduation, jumping to 88% in the first few years after graduation."

* "For fellows in specialties that significantly rely on technology, the proportion was even higher â€” 80% received payments before graduating and 96% afterward."

* "From 2013 to 2024, [U.S. physicians received $12.1 billion](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/doctors-bonus-payments-covid-vaccine-medicaid/) from industry, with more than half receiving at least one payment, according to a March 2024 [review of the Open Payments database.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2816900)"
