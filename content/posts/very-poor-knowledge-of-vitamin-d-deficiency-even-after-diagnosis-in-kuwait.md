<H2 CLASS="western">Abstract</H2>

<H4 CLASS="western">Background</H4>

<P>Extracellular calcium is vital for the functioning of many

metabolic processes and neuromuscular activities. Awareness and

practice of patients with vitamin D deficiency are very important.</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Objective</H4>

<P>To explore knowledge, attitude and practice of patients receiving

vitamin D supplement and attending primary health care (PHC) in

Kuwait.</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Subjects and methods</H4>

<P>The study design is a simple descriptive cross-sectional one that

was carried out in two PHC centers. Two hundred patients were

selected randomly from a list of all registered patients in the

selected centers. Criteria for inclusion included adult age

~18&nbsp;years, diagnosis with hypovitaminosis D within a

year, and under vitamin D supplement.</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Results</H4>

<P>Only 28.5% of participants were aware about their condition, 53.5%

related pain to vitamin D deficiency, 33.5% knew the presence of

relation between vitamin D deficiency and joint pain. One third of

the participants received the loading dose of vitamin D, and, 17.5%

had the maintenance dose. Only 21.0% believed that they feel better

regarding musculoskeletal symptoms after taking treatment doses and

12.5% of the participants knew that the level of vitamin D dropped

again after stopping medication. Only 29.5% knew the relation between

vitamin D and other diseases. The majority of patients (85.5%) agreed

about the importance of sunshine as a source of vitamin D and 60.0%

thought that they can get vitamin D from the nutrients. Regarding the

main sources of knowledge about vitamin D, 40.5 % of patients got

knowledge from doctors, 12.5% from the media, 29.0% from relatives

and friends, 8.5% from background information and 9.5% from journals

and magazines.</P>

<H4 CLASS="western">Conclusions</H4>

<P>The majority of the study participants had limited knowledge, poor

practices, and negative attitude toward vitamin D problems. Planning

health education interventions for this group of patients are

essential.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="s0005"></A>1. Introduction</H2>

Vitamin D plays a primary physiological role in maintaining

extracellular calcium ion levels in the human body. Extracellular

calcium is vital for the functioning of many metabolic processes and

neuromuscular activities. Vitamin D influences calcium levels

primarily by controlling the absorption of calcium from the

intestine, through the direct effects on bone and also through its

effects on parathyroid hormone secretion.<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0005"><SUP>1</SUP></A>

Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency, resulting in decreased bone

mineralization, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and increased cortical

bone loss, has been linked to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and

hip fractures.<SUP><A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0010">[2]</A>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0015">[3]</A></SUP>

Vitamin D is acquired both through nutritional means (10&ndash;20%)

and by the cutaneous synthesis under the action of sunlight

(80&ndash;90%).<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0020"><SUP>4</SUP></A>

Vitamin D may play a role in muscle strength, pathogenesis of

psoriasis, certain cancers, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and blood

pressure, among other physiological and pathophysiological

processes.<SUP><A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0025">[5]</A>,

Determining vitamin D status of a population can be a challenging

task.<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0040"><SUP>8</SUP></A>

Earlier observational studies have measured serum 25(OH)D levels in

healthy population cohorts to determine reference values for

sufficient levels of vitamin D. However, these are known to be

influenced by lifestyle and environmental characteristics and,

therefore, may not be applied clinically and worldwide.<SUP><A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0005">[1]</A>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0010">[2]</A></SUP></P>

Clinical hypovitaminosis D is associated with rickets in infancy and

osteomalacia in adults, which causes muscle weakness and contributes

to falls and bone fractures.<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0025"><SUP>5</SUP></A>

Defining categories of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency will

affect the prevention strategies employed in a clinical setting.

These are oral vitamin D supplementation, increased exposure to UV

light (especially sunlight), and a better dietary intake.<SUP><A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0010">[2]</A>,

Studies from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, and Iran

reveal that 10&ndash;60%of mothers and 40&ndash;80% of their neonates

had undetectable low vitamin D levels (0&ndash;25&nbsp;nmol/L) at

delivery. Higher socioeconomic status, antenatal care, and vitamin D

intake were associated with higher vitamin D levels.<SUP><A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0050">[10]</A>,

<P><A NAME="p0030"></A>The aim of the present study was to explore

knowledge, attitude and practice of patients attending primary health

care (PHC) centers for vitamin D supplement.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="s0010"></A>2. Methods</H2>

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="s0015"></A>2.1. Setting and design</H3>

<P><A NAME="p0035"></A>The study design is a descriptive

cross-sectional one that was carried out in two PHC centers. Kuwait

was divided into five health regions, and each individual in the

population was linked to one of the PHC units that are available in

all residential areas in Kuwait. Two health regions were selected

randomly for conducting the study, Capital and Hawalli. From each one

PHC center was chosen randomly (AlSalam health center in Hawalli

region and AlKhaldiya health center in the Capital region). Within

each selected center a list of all patients &gt;18&nbsp;years old,

newly diagnosed and receiving vitamin D therapy was prepared. This

study was conducted during the period from August to December 2010.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="s0020"></A>2.2. Subjects</H3>

<P><A NAME="p0040"></A>The study population was Kuwaiti and

non-Kuwaiti patients who attend the PHC centers for treatment by

vitamin D supplement. Upon reviewing the computerized database of the

selected centers, all registered subjects aged ~18&nbsp;years

within the enrollment period were identified (1050 registered

patients were in AlSalam center and 795 were in Khaldiya), and a

random sample of 200 patients were proportionally and electronically

selected. Selected subjects were recalled for interview and their

records were reviewed manually for extraction of the required

information.</P>

<P><A NAME="p0045"></A>Subjects were eligible for the study if they

were ~18&nbsp;years old, newly diagnosed with vitamin D

deficiency, under vitamin D treatment and registered in the selected

centers within the enrollment period. Subjects were excluded from the

study, if they presented with acute disease during the last two weeks

preceding the study or diagnosed earlier than a year.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="s0025"></A>2.3. Data collection</H3>

<P><A NAME="p0050"></A>The necessary data were collected with a

structured questionnaire and via the interviews between the trained

interviewers and the eligible subject. Also, patients&rsquo; records

were reviewed for abstracting data regarding the intake of loading

and maintenance dose of vitamin D. Loading dose was defined as

monthly injection of weekly capsules of 50,000&nbsp;IU and

maintenance dose as 1000&nbsp;IU/day for 8&nbsp;weeks. The collected

data included information related to patient&rsquo;s knowledge about

the signs and symptoms of vitamin D deficiency as bone pain, muscle

pain and joint pain, attitude toward vitamin D treatment, right or

wrong beliefs about the relation between vitamin D and some chronic

diseases, practice regarding intake of loading and maintenance doses

as well as exposure to health sun rays. The sources of patients&rsquo;

knowledge about vitamin D test was also inquired.</P>

<P><A NAME="p0055"></A>All the necessary approvals for carrying out

the research were obtained. The Ethical Committee of the Kuwaiti

Ministry of Health approved the research. A written format explaining

the purpose of the research was prepared and signed by the

participant.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="s0030"></A>3. Statistical analysis</H2>

<P><A NAME="p0060"></A>Data were collected and coded then entered

into an IBM compatible computer, using the SPSS version 12 for

Windows. Simple descriptive statistics were used. Qualitative

variables were expressed as number and percentage while quantitative

variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="s0035"></A>4. Results</H2>

<P><A NAME="p0065"></A><A NAME="bt0005"></A><A NAME="ancbt0005"></A>The

general characteristics of the participants were illustrated in <A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#t0005">table

1</A>.The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 62&nbsp;years

with a mean&nbsp;=&nbsp;41.3&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;14.3&nbsp;years. Two

thirds of them were females and 33.5% were males, about one fifth of

the sample were non-Kuwaiti, while the majority were Kuwaiti patients

(81.0%).A one third of the participants were highly educated, only 7%

positioned in professional jobs, the majority were married (81.5%),

two thirds had monthly family income &gt;1000&nbsp;KD. The mean

vitamin D level ranged from 4 to 76&nbsp;nmol/L (mean&nbsp;=&nbsp;23.5&nbsp;+&nbsp;6.2).</P>

Individuals with vitamin D deficiency have proximal muscle atrophy

and loss of type II muscle fibers. They usually recover within

6&ndash;12&nbsp;months of vitamin D supplementation. These effects

may be a direct consequence of the action of vitamin D on specific

receptors on skeletal muscle or mediated by the effects of vitamin D

on serum calcium and phosphate.<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0025"><SUP>5</SUP></A>

The results of the current study revealed the lack of knowledge among

the participants of the study regarding the effect of vitamin D

deficiency. The low level of knowledge found in this study is in

keeping with the reports of other studies that revealed that vitamin

D deficiency has been associated with impaired muscle strength<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0030"><SUP>6</SUP></A>

and that inadequate vitamin D is associated with increased body

sway.<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0035"><SUP>7</SUP></A>

In a similar study on hypertensive patients, it was shown that poor

perception of good health and irregular visits to physician are some

of the most important factors for unawareness, untreated and

uncontrolled hypertension.<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0070"><SUP>14</SUP></A>

Also, the relatively lower levels of education of a considerable

proportion of participants in this study could contribute to the lack

of knowledge and awareness. Patient education plays a critical role

in facilitating patients&rsquo; acceptance of their diagnosis and

understanding behavioral changes required for the participation in

treatment.<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0075"><SUP>15</SUP></A></P>

Vitamin D may play a role in muscle strength, pathogenesis of certain

cancers, some skin and other chronic diseases. When patients were

asked about the relation between vitamin D and other diseases like

cardiovascular, diabetes mellitus, depression, hypercholestermia,

cancer and multiple sclerosis, only 29.5% believed positively.<SUP><A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0025">[5]</A>,

Although the best-characterized sequel of vitamin D deficiency

involves the musculoskeletal system, a growing body of evidence

suggests that low levels of vitamin D may adversely affect the

cardiovascular system.<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0080"><SUP>16</SUP></A>

Clinical studies have reported cross-sectional associations between

lower vitamin D levels and blood pressure, coronary artery

calcification, and prevalent cardiovascular disease.<SUP><A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0080">[16]</A>,

Despite these clinical observations, prospective data are needed

because vitamin D deficiency could be a consequence of cardiovascular

disease rather than a cause. Thus, patients knowledge regarding this

issue could not be taken as an indicator for their awareness

regarding the results of vitamin D deficiency.</P>

<P><A NAME="p0105"></A><A NAME="bb00201"></A><A NAME="ancbb00201"></A>

Vitamin D is acquired both through nutritional means (10&ndash;20%)

and by the cutaneous synthesis under the action of sunlight

(80&ndash;90%).<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0020"><SUP>4</SUP></A>

Participants in our study had the right attitude toward sunshine,

where 85.5% agreed about the importance of sunshine as a source of

vitamin D, 60.0% thought that they can get vitamin D from nutrients

as milk products and oily fish. It is indicated that patients with

vitamin D deficiency had adequate general knowledge and awareness

about the importance of sun rays as a source of vitamin D, but they

did not practice enough exposure to sun as they have no comprehensive

understanding of their condition.</P>

About one third of the participants mentioned that they got the

loading dose of vitamin D and only 17.5% reported that they had the

maintenance dose. These figures should be taken cautiously as many

patients received the prescribed treatment without discussing its

nature with their physicians due to the overload of work of them.

Also, patients could have the impression that the treatment is for

relieving their musculoskeletal symptoms. More than a half of the

participants reported that they either not exposed or spend less than

three times per week under the sunshine for 20&nbsp;min between the

time 9&nbsp;am&ndash;3&nbsp;pm, while 25.5% practiced that 3&ndash;4

times and less than one fifth of cases practiced that from 5 to 7

times. Other studies revealed that vitamin D is predominantly derived

from exposure of the skin to solar ultraviolet B

radiation.<SUP><A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0095">[19]</A>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0100">[20]</A></SUP>

Natural dietary sources of vitamin D are limited, unless

fortification or supplementation practices are adopted.<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0105"><SUP>21</SUP></A>

Knowledge of vitamin D testing is confused between the participants.

The lack of knowledge and beliefs may be related to the effects of

different dress styles in working, where exposure to sunlight is

supposed to be adequate in summer time and negligible in winter in

Gulf countries. For religious and cultural reasons, women&rsquo;s

dress styles range from those that totally cover the whole body,

including the hands and face, to western-type dress styles. Women

wearing these continue doing so during their working hours, but

usually free themselves from these dresses inside their homes and

this could expose them to deficiency.<A HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209050681200022X#b0020"><SUP>4</SUP></A>

Therefore, health education programs should be targeted at women

through various media including leaflets, television, and radio.</P>

<P><A NAME="p0115"></A>We apologize certain limitations of this

study. One of this limitation is non inclusion of many categories of

patients who may have better knowledge, attitude and practice than

those participated in the study. Another limitation is conducting the

study in two centers only. However, the general characteristics of

the practice and the study population shared many of the features of

all health structures available in Kuwait.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="s0045"></A>6. Conclusion</H2>

<P><A NAME="p0120"></A>Our results indicated that the majority of the

study participants had limited knowledge, poor practices, and

negative attitude toward vitamin D problems and have to improve.

Health care workers may play an important role in communicating

health behaviors to the general public and planning health education

interventions for this group of patients.</P>
