 **[Vitamin K Supplementation to Reduce Deficiencies in Adults With Cystic Fibrosis (VITK-FK)](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04496921?sfpd_s=07%2F21%2F2020&sfpd_d=14)** 

Group A:  2mg, every day for 6 months

Group B: 7mg, twice a week for 6 months

Apparently using phylloquinone = K1

Wonder about K2 and D3

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited genetic disorder with multiorgan involvement. Gastrointestinal tract dysfunction leads to fat and fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) malabsorption and deficiency of these vitamins. Subclinical vitamin K (VK) deficiency seems to be a common problem in CF patients. However, despite the rest of fat-soluble vitamins being routinely supplemented, this is not a universal clinical practice for VK. Inefficient levels of VK may have significant effects on blood coagulation and bone formation. There are also some data indicating that VK may play a key role on regulation of inflammation. Supplementing CF patients with VK seems rational, but the appropriate dosing regimens are still a matter of debate. This review will try to delineate the problem and communicate the latest opinions on this controversial issue.
