Introduction

ALA Deficiency

* "Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is an essential omega-3 fatty acid. It is necessary for our health, but our bodies canâ€™t produce it. We need to take it through food (and supplements)"

* ALA is found in  **flaxseed oil** , chia seeds, sage, some vegetables, and nut oils.
