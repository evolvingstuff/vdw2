Background: Rickets is a common metabolic bone disease in children, primarily caused by vitamin D deficiency. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of oral weekly vitamin D supplementation and injectable stoss therapy in treating nutritional rickets in Indian children.

Methods: This prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted over 18 months at a tertiary care center. Forty children aged 6 months to 16 years with clinical, biochemical, and radiological evidence of nutritional rickets were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either oral vitamin D3 (60,000 IU weekly for 10 weeks) or a single intramuscular injection of vitamin D3 (600,000 IU). Clinical, biochemical, and radiological assessments were conducted at baseline and at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post-treatment.

Results: Both treatment regimens significantly improved vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, with no significant differences between the groups. Radiological healing, assessed by Thacher's score, was achieved in both groups by 6 months. While both treatments were effective, injectable stoss therapy resulted in a more sustained increase in vitamin D levels and may offer better compliance due to its single-dose administration. No cases of local skin complications or vitamin D toxicity or symptomatic hypercalcemia were observed.

Conclusion: Oral weekly and injectable stoss therapies are both effective and safe for treating nutritional rickets. Injectable stoss therapy may be more suitable for the Indian population due to its cost-effectiveness and lower compliance demands. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels emerged as a useful early marker of rickets severity as well as treatment response. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent long-term skeletal deformities.
