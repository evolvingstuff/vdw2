#### The relationship between vitamin D and chemotherapy-induced toxicity - a pilot study.

Background:There are anecdotal data that lower levels of vitamin D may be associated with increased levels of toxicity in individuals receiving chemotherapy; we therefore wished to investigate this further.Methods:From a cohort of over 11?000 individuals, we included those who had vitamin D levels (serum 1,25(OH)(2)D3) measured before and during chemotherapy. They were analysed for side effects correlating Chemotherapy Toxicity Criteria with vitamin D levels, normalising data for general markers of patient health including C-reactive protein and albumin.Results:A total of 241 (2% of the total cohort) individuals entered the toxicity analysis. We found no overall difference in toxicity effects experienced by patients depending on whether they were vitamin D depleted or had sufficient levels (P=0.78).

Conclusion:This pilot study suggests routine vitamin D measurement during treatment does not appear to be necessary in the management of chemotherapy-induced toxicity.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 15 May 2012; doi:10.1038/bjc.2012.194 www.bjcancer.com.
