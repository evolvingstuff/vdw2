#### SUDs rates highest in head, neck, and gastric cancer survivors

 **[MD Edge](https://www.mdedge.com/hematology-oncology/article/267385/mixed-topics/suds-rates-highest-head-neck-and-gastric-cancer?ecd=WNL_EVE_240118_mdedge)** 

* "Nearly 10% of survivors of head, neck, esophageal, and gastric cancers experienced active  **substance use disorders** , based on data from more than 6,000 individuals."

* Reporting on: Substance Use Disorders Among US Adult Cancer Survivors - Jan 2024 doi:10.1001/jamaoncol.2023.5785 PDF is behind a paywall

* Study only looked at solid cancers

 **Study Results**   This study included data from 6101 adult cancer survivors (56.91% were aged 65 years or older and 61.63% were female). Among lifetime cancer survivors, the prevalence of active SUD was 3.83% (SE, 0.32%). Substance use disorder was most prevalent in survivors of head and neck cancer (including mouth, tongue, lip, throat, and pharyngeal cancers; 9.36% <span>[SE, 2.47%]</span>), esophageal and gastric cancer (9.42% <span>[SE, 5.51%]</span>), cervical cancer (6.24% <span>[SE, 1.41%]</span>), and melanoma (6.20% <span>[SE, 1.34%]</span>). 

Alcohol use disorder was the most common SUD (2.78% <span>[SE, 0.26%]</span>) overall and in survivors of head and neck cancer, cervical cancer, and melanoma. 

In survivors of esophageal and gastric cancers, cannabis use disorder was the most prevalent SUD (9.42% <span>[SE, 5.51%]</span>). 

Among respondents diagnosed with cancer in the past 12 months, the overall prevalence of active SUD was similar to that in the lifetime cancer survivor cohort (3.81% <span>[SE, 0.74%]</span>). 

However, active SUD prevalence was higher in head and neck (18.73% <span>[SE, 10.56%]</span>) and cervical cancer survivors (15.70% <span>[SE, 5.35%]</span>). 

The distribution of specific SUDs was different compared with that in the lifetime cancer survivor cohort. For example, in recently diagnosed head and neck cancer survivors, sedative use disorder was the most common SUD (9.81% <span>[SE, 9.17%]</span>).

!!!!SUDs rates highest in head, neck, and gastric cancer survivors
__[https://www.mdedge.com/hematology-oncology/article/267385/mixed-topics/suds-rates-highest-head-neck-and-gastric-cancer?ecd=WNL_EVE_240118_mdedge|MD Edge]__
*&quot;Nearly 10% of survivors of head, neck, esophageal, and gastric cancers experienced active __substance use disorders__, based on data from more than 6,000 individuals.&quot;
*Reporting on: Substance Use Disorders Among US Adult Cancer Survivors - Jan 2024 doi:10.1001/jamaoncol.2023.5785 PDF is behind a paywall
*Study only looked at solid cancers

__Study Results__  This study included data from 6101 adult cancer survivors (56.91% were aged 65 years or older and 61.63% were female). Among lifetime cancer survivors, the prevalence of active SUD was 3.83% (SE, 0.32%). Substance use disorder was most prevalent in survivors of head and neck cancer (including mouth, tongue, lip, throat, and pharyngeal cancers; 9.36% [SE, 2.47%]), esophageal and gastric cancer (9.42% [SE, 5.51%]), cervical cancer (6.24% [SE, 1.41%]), and melanoma (6.20% [SE, 1.34%]). 
Alcohol use disorder was the most common SUD (2.78% [SE, 0.26%]) overall and in survivors of head and neck cancer, cervical cancer, and melanoma. 
In survivors of esophageal and gastric cancers, cannabis use disorder was the most prevalent SUD (9.42% [SE, 5.51%]). 
Among respondents diagnosed with cancer in the past 12 months, the overall prevalence of active SUD was similar to that in the lifetime cancer survivor cohort (3.81% [SE, 0.74%]). 
However, active SUD prevalence was higher in head and neck (18.73% [SE, 10.56%]) and cervical cancer survivors (15.70% [SE, 5.35%]). 
The distribution of specific SUDs was different compared with that in the lifetime cancer survivor cohort. For example, in recently diagnosed head and neck cancer survivors, sedative use disorder was the most common SUD (9.81% [SE, 9.17%]).
