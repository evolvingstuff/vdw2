#### Investigation of Long COVID Prevalence and Its Relationship to Epstein-Barr Virus Reactivation - June 2021

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients sometimes experience long-term symptoms following resolution of acute disease, including fatigue, brain fog, and rashes. Collectively these have become known as long COVID. Our aim was to first determine long COVID prevalence in 185 randomly surveyed COVID-19 patients and, subsequently, to determine if there was an association between occurrence of long COVID symptoms and reactivation of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) in 68 COVID-19 patients recruited from those surveyed. We found the prevalence of long COVID symptoms to be 30.3% (56/185), which included 4 initially asymptomatic COVID-19 patients who later developed long COVID symptoms. Next, we found that 66.7% (20/30) of long COVID subjects versus 10% (2/20) of control subjects in our primary study group were positive for EBV reactivation based on positive titers for EBV early antigen-diffuse (EA-D) IgG or EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM. The difference was significant (p < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test). A similar ratio was observed in a secondary group of 18 subjects 21–90 days after testing positive for COVID-19, indicating reactivation may occur soon after or concurrently with COVID-19 infection. These findings suggest that many long COVID symptoms may not be a direct result of the SARS-CoV-2 virus but may be the result of COVID-19 inflammation-induced EBV reactivation.

##### Comment on Long-Haul COVID and virus such as EBV - Aug 27, 2021

 **[Preventing The Post-COVID Syndrone (long-haul COVID) Sunil Wimalawansa, Linked-In ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sunilwimalawansa_preventing-the-post-covid-syndrone-long-haul-activity-6837097026711371776-5s6R/)** 

COVID-19 significantly impair the immune system, including its regulation. SARS-CoV-2 infections in persons with vitamin D deficiency is subjected to a double whammy. 

Postmortem sample indicates that SARS.CoV-2 is present within brain tissues and in endocrine organs. Resultant significant immune dysfunction causes enhance viral replication and dissemination, and autoimmunity, and activating "dormant" microbes. The latter include activation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; Infectious mononucleosis) its complications like thrombocytopenic purpura, and intracellular bacteria, like tuberculosis.  

The post-Covid syndrome is likely to  **cause by SARS-CoV-2 and/or EBV, and other dormant viruses** .  At present, its natural history, duration, and the optimal way to treat it are unknown. Nevertheless, maintaining serum 25(OH)D above 50 ng/mL seem to prevent this syndrome and supplementing vitamin D expedites the recovery following post-COVID syndrome. It is likely due to restoring the robust immune system). 

Moreover, the efficacy of vaccines is enhanced with vitamin D adequacy. Therefore, administering a one-time high dose of oral vitamin D (e.g., 200,000 IU), as we have advocated since January 2021, is a sensible measure to enhance the acquired immunity and avoid a third booster dose.  Prevention is better than cure.

#### EBV has a protein which is similar to that used to make myelin - Feb 2024

* "Almost all ms patients show signs of ebv infection, but so do around 95% of healthy adults"

* "...Harvard University tracked more than 10m American military employees who were given regular blood tests for hiv. During the study, 955 of the soldiers were diagnosed with ms. The scientists then went back and tested the blood samples taken before the soldiers’ diagnoses, for signs of ebv infection. **All but one had antibodies for the virus** , a rate far higher than would be expected by chance."

* "A paper published in Nature in 2022 showed that a protein produced by ebv shares a similar structure with a protein in human cells crucial for the production of myelin."

#### Long-Haul EBV on the web

   * "Two-thirds of a group of 30 COVID long-haul patients had high levels of Epstein-Barr antibodies, suggesting that EBV lying dormant in their bodies had been reactivated by their coronavirus infection, researchers reported."

* [Long COVID in Kids: The New Mono?](https://www.eatthis.com/news-long-covid-kids-mono-link/) Aug 19, 2021

   * "Mononucleosis was nicknamed the kissing disease for one simple reason: college students, most at risk for developing this infection, presumably spend massive amounts of time sharing germs with their friends."

   * "While most people recover in two weeks with rest and fluids, the virus that causes mono, Epstein Barr (EBV), is also associated with a chronic inflammatory and painful condition called myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Also known as Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), this syndrome has itself been compared to Long COVID.4 "

   * "And the list goes on. Through a protein on the virus, EBV has also been identified as a common infectious activator or trigger of several autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and celiac disease.5"
