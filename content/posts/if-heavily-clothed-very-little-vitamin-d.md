Vitamin - D deficiency is a worldwide problem and the prevalence of deficiency reaches more than 50% of the population in most of the studies and causes of deficiency are either inadequate intake of food containing vitamin - D or inadequate exposure to sun light which plays an important role of biosynthesis of vitamin- D from the skin, vitamin -D deficiency is linked to many diseases like cancer, diabetes, bone disorders, hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia and many other disorders and correction of 25 -vitamin - D deficiency which is very simple and available and not expensive improves those disorders significantly. 

This work aimed to screening for vitamin 25- D deficiency among premenopausal women working in Fayoum University. 

Subjects and methods: two hundred healthy premenopausal non pregnant non lactating females aged 40-50 years old working at Fayoum University, subjected to thorough medical history and clinical examination, stressing on color of the skin BMI and style of clothing and all patients are screened for 25- vitamin D using ELISA. 

Results: Our results showed that 45 females of 200 were sufficient (22.5%), 91 females were insufficient (45.5%), 64 females were deficient (32%). Vitamin D deficient females subdivided into deficient (82.8%) and severely deficient (17.2%). there was significant difference between the mean of vitamin -D in the different BMI, in normal body weight subjects the mean of vitamin D level was 77.9 ± 21.7 in overweight was 51.4 ± 15.5 in obese (40 ± 22.4) and the difference is highly statistically significant (p < 0.001). The mean vitamin -D level for 

* western wearing clothes was 66.8 ± 16.4, for ladies wearing 

* Higab was 62 ± 23.2), and for ladies wearing 

* Niqab 28.3 ± 16.3 

and the difference is highly statistically significant (p < 0.001). 

The mean of vitamin D level in dark skinned subjects was 57.2 ± 21.2 while in white skinned subjects was 96.2 ± 33.8 and the difference is highly statistically significant (p < 0.001). 

Conclusion: More than 75 % of the premenopausal women working in Fayoum University had either vitamin -D deficiency or insufficiency. obesity, darker skin and insufficient sun exposure are the main factors leading to or associated with 25 - vitamin - D deficiency
