* Less than 6% of ALA is metabolized to EPA 

* The upper level EPA  food intake of the 150,000 women was 8% of their upper ALA intake

* So, the ALA benefit might actually have been due to the resulting EPA in the body

* EPA intake did not help AFTER being adjusted for Vitamin D levels

   *  **Thus: EPA weight was adjusted down for those taking a lot of vitamin D** 

* Note - this study is based on food questionaries given every 4 years

   * The study is also based on a total of only 30 MS cases in 300,000 study years ( 1 per 10,000 case years)
