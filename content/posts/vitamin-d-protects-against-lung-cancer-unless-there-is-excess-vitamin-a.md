OBJECTIVE: Excess vitamin A may interrupt vitamin D-mediated transcription of target genes. This study investigated whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations were associated with lung cancer mortality, and whether this association varied by excess circulating vitamin A and vitamin A/?-carotene supplement use.

METHOD: We analyzed 16,693 men and women in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), 1988-1994. Lung cancer mortality (n = 258, 104 were former smokers and 23 were never smokers) were identified through National Death Index as of 2006. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by a radioimmunoassay. Vitamin A biomarkers including serum retinol, ?-carotene, and retinyl esters were measured by HPLC. Supplement use for the past month was obtained by self-report. Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were estimated by Cox proportional hazard models.

RESULTS: There was no association of serum 25(OH)D with overall lung cancer mortality. 

Among nonsmokers, ?44 vs. <44 nmol/L of serum 25(OH)D was associated with a decreased risk (HR = 0.53, 95 % CI = 0.31-0.92, former/never smokers and 

HR = 0.31, 95 % CI = 0.13-0.77, distant-former <span>[quit ?20 years]</span>/never smokers). 

The associations were not observed among participants with excess circulating vitamin A (serum retinyl esters ?7.0 ?g/dL or the ratio of retinyl esters to retinol ?0.08) or vitamin A/?-carotene supplement users. However, statistical evidence to support effect modification of vitamin A was less clear.

CONCLUSIONS: Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were inversely associated with lung cancer mortality in nonsmokers. 

The beneficial association was diminished among those with excess circulating vitamin A or vitamin A/?-carotene supplement users.
