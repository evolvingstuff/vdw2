Death rates in the U.S. show a pronounced seasonality. The broad seasonal variation shows about 25% higher death rates in winter than in summer with an additional few percent increase associated with the Christmas and New Year's holidays. 

A pronounced increase in death rates also starts in mid-September, shortly after the school year begins. 

The causes of death with large contributions to the observed seasonality include diseases of the 

* circulatory system; the 

* respiratory system; the 

* digestive system; and 

* endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases. 

Researchers have identified several factors showing seasonal variation that could possibly explain the seasonal variations in mortality rate. 

These factors include 

* seasonal variations in solar ultraviolet-B(UVB) doses and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations, 

* gene expression, 

* ambient temperature and humidity, 

* UVB effects on environmental pathogen load, 

* environmental pollutants and allergens, and 

* photoperiod (or length of day). 

The factors with the strongest support in this analysis are 

* seasonal variations in solar UVB doses and 

* 25(OH)D concentrations. 

In the U.S., population mean 25(OH)D concentrations range from 21ng/mL in March to 28ng/mL in August. Measures to ensure that all people had 25(OH)D concentrations >36ng/mL year round would probably reduce death rates significantly.
