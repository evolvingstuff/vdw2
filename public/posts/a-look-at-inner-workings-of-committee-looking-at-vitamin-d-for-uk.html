Osteoporos Int. 2013. Jan 9 <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span>.</p><p>(a) The sun is the main source of UVR. Solar UVR is categorised into three types according to</p><p>wavelength (nmd): UVA (315-400 nm), UVB (280-315 nm) and UVC (100-280 nm). UV penetrance of skin is very low for UVC, medium for UVB and deepest for UVA.</p><p>(b) The spectrum of solar radiation is modified on its path through the atmosphere. Ozone is a key factor in reducing and modifying the UVR reaching ground level. As solar radiation passes through the atmosphere, UVC and 90% of UVB is absorbed by ozone. The amount of UVR reaching ground level is modified by factors such as altitude, ground reflection of UVR (e.g., sand reflects 25%; snow reflects 80%), cloud cover and shade.</p><p>(c) The Solar UV Index (1 to 20) is used to advise populations on the strength of the sun&rsquo;s UVR. In the UK, the UV Index does not usually exceed 8.</p><p>(d) Skin exposure to UVR is dependent on a number of factors, including exposure angle. An area of skin exposed to incoming radiation at a perpendicular angle receives a larger radiation dose than exposure at a higher or lower angle. This makes it difficult to measure a person&rsquo;s actual UV exposure. Skin exposure to UVR is also modified by clothes and sunscreen.</p><p>(e) Biological effects of UVR on skin include erythemae, tanning, skin ageing, skin cancer and immune suppression.</p><p>(f) Skin type is classified into 6 categories according to its response to UVR: from most sensitive (type I/fair skin) to least sensitive (type VI/dark brown or black skin). Two measures are used to quantify erythema risk: the standard erythemal dose (SED) and the minimal erythemal dose (MED). SED is a fixed physical quantity, equal to 100 J/m2. The MED varies in each person because the amount of UVR required to produce a just-measurable degree of erythema depends on skin type, time of year, behaviour and possibly age; one MED is the minimum dose of UVR that produces erythema in that person&rsquo;s skin.</p><p>(g) UVA and UVB are implicated in photoageing, which is caused by cumulative exposure to sun.</p><p>(h) Skin cancers are classified into non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) and malignant melanoma (MM). NMSCs include squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Epidemiological evidence suggests a link between SCCs and cumulative lifetime exposure in Caucasians. Although exposure to UVR is implicated in BCC risk, the link with cumulative exposure is less clear. The risk of MM is associated with excessive UVR exposure, however the risk of MM is greater in indoor than in outdoor workers; large bursts of UVR may play a role in disease aetiology.</p><p>d Nanometers.</p><p>e Redness of skin/sunburn.</p><p>(i) Skin exposure to UVR can cause a suppressed immune response to cutaneously presented antigens.</p><p>(j) UVR can also cause eye damage. While UVC is absorbed at the cornea surface, UVB</p><p>penetrates further into the cornea and UVA into the lens. Acute UV exposure of the eye may result in photokeratitis and photoconjunctivitis. The role of UVR in cataract is unclear. UVR does not appear to play a role in age-related macular degeneration.</p><ol start=6><li>The chair thanked Dr O&rsquo;Hagan for his presentation.</li></ol><h3 id=agenda-item-3-the-photobiology-of-vitamin-d-sacnvitd1249>Agenda item 3: The photobiology of vitamin D (SACNvitD/12/49)</h3><ol start=7><li>The chair invited Professor Antony Young to give his presentation on the photobiology of vitamin D. The main points are summarised below.</li></ol><p>(a) Action spectra (wavelength dependence) have been established by the Commission Internationale de l&rsquo;Eclairage (CIE) for different endpoints (e.g., pre-vitamin D production, erythema).</p><p>(b) Biological efficacy is more important than the relative amounts of UVA and UVB in sunlight. There is much more UVA than UVB at any time of the year but, if it is biologically weighted with the erythema action spectrum, UVB is much more effective than UVA for erythema. In winter, the relative contribution of UVA and UVB is similar.</p><p>(c) The erythema action spectrum is based on a mathematical composite of several studies. However, the action spectrum for pre-vitamin D production in human skin is based on a single skin sample (skin type III) and recent reviews have queried its reliability.</p><p>(d) Laboratory studies use UVB phototherapy sources, which also contain non-solar UVB radiation (&lt; 295 nm) that is very effective at vitamin D production but makes it difficult to make comparisons with solar UVR.</p><p>(e) Laboratory studies have shown an inverse relationship between baseline 25(OH)D status and response to UVB. There are also important interactions between UVR dose and body surface area; higher doses are needed if a small area of the body is exposed while lower doses are adequate if larger body surfaces are exposed. Studies conducted as part of the ICEPURE project, which determined vitamin D status before and after holidays, have shown an increase in 25(OH)D concentrations at an individual and mean level but little correlation between an individual&rsquo;s UVR exposure and increase in 25(OH)D concentration.</p><p>(f) It is assumed that melanin is photoprotective because epidemiological studies have shown that people with darker skin have lower 25(OH)D concentrations than those with lighter skins. However, the limited number of laboratory studies have given contradictory results.</p><p>(g) Although sunscreen is advocated for prevention of sunburn, overall, the data show that vitamin D synthesis is still possible when sunscreens are used at the application density used for sun protection factor testing.</p><p>(h) One study (Webb et al, 1989f) using ex-vivo neo-natal foreskin has suggested that UVA degrades vitamin D but this has not been investigated in vivo.</p><ol start=8><li>The Chair thanked Professor Young for his presentation.</li></ol><h3 id=agenda-item-4-discussion>Agenda item 4: Discussion</h3><ol start=9><li>In the discussion that followed the two presentations, the following points were noted:</li></ol><p>(a) The sun protection factor provided by a tan (i.e., induced pigmentation) is not as protective as naturally darker skin.</p><p>(b) Different skin types have different vitamin D binding protein profiles; however, studies do not usually take this into account.</p><p>(c) The extent of the effect of latitude on vitamin D synthesis in the UK is not clear. While it probably has some effect, it could be relatively small compared to other factors. A studyg which compared 25(OHD) concentrations in postmenopausal women residing in Aberdeen (north) and Guildford (south) reported a difference of approximately 10 nmol/L; however this difference might not be due to solar radiation. Although UVB (as a proportion of UVR) lessens with increasingly northern latitudes, the weather also gets progressively colder so people go outdoors less. There are also differences in the area of skin exposed.</p><p>(d) The uncertainty of the official CIE action spectrum for pre-vitamin D production is not well understood.</p><ol start=10><li>The Chair again thanked Professor Young for attending the meeting and for his presentation on the photobiology of vitamin D, which had helped to increase the WG&rsquo;s understanding of this complex subject.</li></ol><p>f Webb AR, DeCosta BR, Holick MF.

It was noted that since very few studies provided data on calcium intake, it had not been possible to clarify whether the rickets had been caused by vitamin D or calcium deficiency.</p></li><li><p>Contact British Paediatric & Adolescent Bone Group to check if any information available on number of patients in UK hospitals being treated for rickets (and the proportion caused by vitamin D deficiency) - Replies had been received from Dr Nick Shaw (Consultant Paediatric Endocrinologist, Birmingham) and Dr Paul Arundel (Consultant Paediatrician in Metabolic Bone Disease, Sheffield) (SACNvitD/12/51b). Dr Arundel did not have any useful local data. Dr Nick Shaw did not think there was any good information on the numbers of children being treated for vitamin D deficiency rickets in the UK. He had forwarded copies of two papers (Ahmed et al, 2011 & Moy et al, 2012). Ahmed et al (2011) documented cases of vitamin D deficiency presenting to a children&rsquo;s hospital in Glasgow, while Moy et al (2012) reported on the success of an initiative in Birmingham to promote vitamin D supplementation for all children under the age of 5 years. Members agreed that the both papers would be of more relevance to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), since NICE is currently developing public health guidance on Safe Implementation of existing evidence based guidance on Vitamin D.</p></li></ol><p>SACNvitD/12/39:</p><h2 id=vitamin-d--bone-health-in-children--adolescents>Vitamin D & bone health in children & adolescents</h2><ul><li>consideration of original studies in Winzenberg et al (2011) meta-analysis</li></ul><ol start=20><li>Include information on compliance in the studies included in meta-analysis - The table had been amended to include information on compliance with the intervention and variance for baseline 25(OH)D concentrations (SACNvitD/12/52).</li></ol><p>SACNvitD/12/40:</p><h2 id=vitamin-d--bone-health-in-postmenopausal-women--older-men--women>Vitamin D & bone health in postmenopausal women & older men & women</h2><p>consideration of baseline 25(OH)D in studies included in IOM report</p><ol start=21><li>Include information on variance in baseline 25(OH)D & reconsider evidence when this had been done - The table had been amended to include information on variance in baseline 25(OH)D concentration (SACN/vitD/12/53).</li></ol><p>SACNvitD/12/41:</p><h2 id=vitamin-d--fracture-prevention-in-postmenopausal-women>Vitamin D & fracture prevention in postmenopausal women</h2><ol start=22><li><p>Check findings from different meta-analyses/systematic reviews that have assessed effect of vitamin D alone or with calcium on fracture risk - The findings from the various meta-analyses/systematic reviews had been tabulated (SACN/vitD/12/54a).</p></li><li><p>Check that any RCTs published since the IOM report have not been missed - The table of studies had been amended to include the number of events (fractures) in each study and 2 large</p></li></ol><p>studies that had not been included in the IOM table (Larsen et al, 2004h; Smith et al, 2007i)</p><p>(SACN/vitD/12/54b). No further studies, published after the IOM report, could be identified; it was noted, however, that there was an additional RCT (Meyer et al, 2002j) that had used cod liver oil as the vitamin D intervention and cod liver oil with the vitamin D removed as the control.</p><p>SACNvitD/12/43a:</p><h2 id=vitamin-d--falls-reduction-in-older-people>Vitamin D & falls reduction in older people</h2><ol start=24><li><p>Since completion of position paper, 1 further RCT identified (Karkkainen et al, 2010) - The paper by Karkkainen et al (2010) had been circulated to Members (SACNvitD/12/55a).</p></li><li><p>Consult with external experts on the interpretation of &lsquo;risk of falling&rsquo; and &lsquo;risk of being a faller&rsquo; - A reply had been received from Professor Julia Newton (Newcastle University). She explained that being a faller is a yes/no response and does not take account of the fact that some fallers might fall once, whereas some might fall on multiple occasions. Since any fall might be the one that leads to a fracture, stopping people falling at all is the ideal scenario, i.e., converting someone from being a faller to a non faller. Although it is easier to demonstrate a reduction in falls, a decrease in the risk of being a faller is probably more important and is generally regarded as a better marker of the efficacy of an intervention.</p></li></ol><p>h Larsen ER, Mosekilde L, Foldspang A.

This was because it represents a mix of diseases and most RCTs were of very small size and conducted in older women who are at greater risk of mortality. It was agreed to reflect further on the evidence for all-cause mortality before concluding on its suitability for informing the setting of DRVs.</li></ol><h2 id=cardiovascular-disease-cvd>Cardiovascular disease (CVD)</h2><ol start=41><li>Members agreed that although prospective studies suggested low 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with increased CVD risk, there was also the suggestion of a U-shaped association. It was agreed that the very limited data from RCTs should be interpreted with caution because most were designed and powered to evaluate effects of vitamin D on musculoskeletal outcome. Members concluded that the evidence on CVD was not sufficiently strong to influence the setting of DRVs for vitamin D.</li></ol><h2 id=hypertension>Hypertension</h2><ol start=42><li><p>Although evidence from meta-analyses of observational studies suggests an inverse association, meta-analyses of RCTs are inconsistent.

It was also noted that most studies focused on the therapeutic effects of vitamin D in patients and that vitamin D might be affected by the acute phase inflammatory response. Members concluded that the evidence on infectious diseases was not sufficient to inform the setting of DRVs for vitamin D.</li></ol><h2 id=autoimmune-disease>Autoimmune disease</h2><ol start=45><li>Members noted that there was a paucity of prospective cohort studies and no RCTs on vitamin D and risk of developing autoimmune disease. Most of the evidence was based on cross-sectional and case-control studies. Members concluded that the evidence on autoimmune disease was not sufficient to inform the setting of DRVs for vitamin D.</li></ol><h2 id=age-related-macular-degeneration>Age-related macular degeneration</h2><ol start=46><li>Members noted that the evidence on vitamin D and age-related macular degeneration is mainly from cross-sectional studies, which are inconsistent. No data from longitudinal or intervention studies were identified. Members concluded that the evidence on age-related macular degeneration was not sufficient to inform the setting of DRVs for vitamin D.</li></ol><h2 id=neuropsychological-functioning>Neuropsychological functioning</h2><ol start=47><li>Members noted that the evidence for an effect of vitamin D on neuropsychological functioning was weak and mainly from cross-sectional and ecological studies.
