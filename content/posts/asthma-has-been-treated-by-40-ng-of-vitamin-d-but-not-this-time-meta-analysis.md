#### The Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation in Children With Asthma: A Meta-Analysis

Background: An increasing number of studies have suggested that vitamin D can be used to treat childhood asthma, but its clinical effects are still unclear. We conducted this meta-analysis to examine the latest estimates of the effectiveness and safety of using vitamin D to treat childhood asthma.

Methods: The PubMed, The Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, Embase, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) describing vitamin D supplementation interventions for asthmatic children. Asthma exacerbation, vitamin D levels, the predicted percentage of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1 %) and adverse effects (AEs) were analyzed as the main outcome measures.

Results: After screening, eight RCTs with 738 children were included. Compared with placebos, vitamin D supplementation had a stronger effect on serum vitamin D levels <span>[mean difference (MD) = 13.51 (4.24, 22.79), p = 0.004]</span>. The pooled results indicated that no significant changes were found between the groups in asthma control, as measured by adopting the following indicators: asthma exacerbation <span>[risk ratio (RR) = 0.92 (0.68, 1.25), p = 0.60]</span>; Childhood Asthma Control Test (CACT) scores <span>[MD = 0.15 (-0.43, 0.74), p = 0.61]</span>; hospitalizations for asthma exacerbation <span>[RR = 1.20 (0.48, 2.96), p = 0.70]</span>; acute care visits <span>[RR = 1.13 (0.77, 1.65), p = 0.63]</span>; steroid use <span>[RR = 1.03 (0.41, 2.57), p = 0.95]</span>; and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) <span>[MD =-3.95 (-22.87, 14.97), p = 0.68]</span>. However, vitamin D supplementation might reduce the FEV1% <span>[MD = -4.77 (-9.35, -0.19), p = 0.04]</span> and the percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%) <span>[MD =-5.01 (-9.99, -0.02), p = 0.05]</span> in patients. Subgroup analysis revealed no difference in AEs between the two groups.

Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation significantly increased patients' serum vitamin D levels, but it had no benefit for asthma control. However, vitamin D supplementation might reduce patients' lung function. It is essential to systemically search for more large-scale, rigorous, and well-designed RCTs to fully confirm these conclusions.

#### 7 possible reasons

 **Genetics**  5 genes can restrict the amount of vitamin D that actually gets to the cells

 **Comorbidities**  other health problems compete for the same vitamin D

 **Lack of Magnesium**  needed to get Vitamin D in the blood into the cells

 **Lack of Zinc**  to get vitamin D into the cells via the Vitamin D Receptor

 **Lack of loading dose**  the successful trial started with a 100,000 IU  loading dose

 **Asthma duration before treatment**  days, months, years

 **Patient age**
