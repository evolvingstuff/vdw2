1. Medical Students rarely get training in nutrition and, most of the nutrition courses focus on food, not sunlight nor supplements

1. [Medical students still get less than half of the Vitamin D questions correct](/posts/medical-students-still-have-poor-vitamin-d-knowledge-score-of-46-out-of-20-poland)

1. There is just too much Vitamin D information to expect a non-specialists to know:   
[Optimal level,](/posts/is-50-ng-of-vitamin-d-too-high-just-right-or-not-enough) [dose size for an individual](/posts/overview-how-much-vitamin-d), [form of Vitamin D](/posts/getting-vitamin-d-into-your-blood-and-cells),[risk factors](/categories/high-risk), [reasons for poor respose](/posts/reasons-for-low-response-to-vitamin-d),[loading doses](/posts/overview-loading-of-vitamin-d), [cofactors](/posts/vitamin-d-cofactors-in-a-nutshell). etc.

1. The Vitamin D information is rapidly changing 

   * New Vitamin D evidence (4,000 studies/year), [often 50 meta-analyses/year](/categories/meta-analysis-of-vitamin-d)

   * Vitamin D levels in people continue to drop rapidly [Military](/posts/military-and-vitamin-d-many-studies), [Canada](/posts/vitamin-d-levels-continue-to-fall-canada-6-percent-drop-from-2009-to-2011), [UK](/posts/3x-more-kids-were-vitamin-d-deficient-when-entering-uk-hospitals-than-4-years-before),  [US and 20 reasons](/posts/many-reasons-why-vitamin-d-deficiency-has-become-epidemic)

   * High levels of Vitamin D require adjusting [cofactors](/posts/vitamin-d-cofactors-in-a-nutshell) and [drug potency](/posts/some-drugs-change-potency-when-vitamin-d-is-increased-increase-in-a-hormone)

1. Doctors will lose customers/money if they prescribe an adequate amount of Vitamin D

   * [17 reasons why are doctors reluctant to accept vitamin D](/posts/17-reasons-why-are-doctors-reluctant-to-accept-vitamin-d)

1. The [Physicians Desk Reference](/posts/physicians-desk-reference-still-only-lists-d2-but-not-vitamin-d3) for doctors continues to only list Vitamin D2, not D3

#### Let us imagine that medical classes could somehow include 2 hours on Vitamin D

1. Much of the information would be obsolete or wrong 10 years later

1. It is doubtful that much of the classroom material would be remembered anyway

1. Two hours is extremely unlikely anyway

   * Doctors perhaps get 5 hours on nutrition, of which Vitamin D might be 10 minutes

#### Examples of changing information

| | |
| --- | --- |
|  **Myth**  |  **Reality**  |
| 400 IU of Vitamin D is enough | ((400 IU of Vitamin D provided no benefit to children (not a surprise) – RCT March 2018 | No longer enough)), <br>and more is needed if weigh than 100 lbs, have dark skin, etc |
| Milk provides enough | Milk barely provided enough for infants, <br>but now most people drink((Skim fat milk provides 3% less vitamin D – May 2016 | low-fat milk)) which provides 2.5X less Vitamin D<br>Also - ((Breast-feeding mothers need 2000 IU of vitamin D to get infants to even 12 ng – July 2015 | Breastfed babies rarely get any Vitamin D unless she supplements)) |
| Salmon has a lot of Vitaamin D | No longer - majority of salmon is now raised in pens  (and has only [1/4 as much Vitamin D)](https://www.vitalchoice.com/article/wild-salmon-beats-farmed-for-vitamin-d-again) |
| Stay out of the sun to avoid Cancer | ((9 minutes of full noon sun daily is all you need (if have white skin and believe that 10 ng is enough) – Aug 2018 | 20 minutes of noon-day sun provides some Vitamin D without Cancer)) |
| 2,000 IU is toxic | ((Myth for 50 years: 2000 IU of vitamin D is toxic - still taught as fact in 2010 | Error was made in the 1940's))  <br>Toxic is > 2,000 IU **/kilogram**  of body weight |
| Vitamin D2 is as good as Vitamin D3 | No: Vets concluded in 2006 that ((Vitamin D2 should not be used as a Vitamin supplement for any mammal – Oct 2006 | no mammal should ever be given Vitamin D2)) |
| Vitamin D can accumulate to toxic levels | No: For > 99.9% of people Vitamin D does NOT accumulate - excess is destroyed by the body |
| Liver and Kidneys activate Vitamin D | Actually >70% of Vitamin D activation is done by the ((Genetics | tissues))<br>Thus topical, spray, mouthwash and perhaps ((Inhaled vitamin D help lungs - many studies | inhaled)) Vitamin D can very important sources |
| Minimize cholesterol intake | No - not only does ((Diet cholesterol not directly linked to heart problems – Mar 2011 | minimizing cholesterol NOT help the heart)), <br>it ((Vitamin D levels are (again) associated with HDL cholesterol levels – Feb 2018 | decreases the ability to make Vit. D)) |
| Not need Vitamin D if live in sunny climate | ((Air Conditioning probably has decreased vitamin D | Air conditioning virtually eliminates)) <br>people going outside during the middle of a hot day |
