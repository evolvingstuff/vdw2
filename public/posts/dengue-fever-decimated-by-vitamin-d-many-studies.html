Besides, treating this disease is difficult, and there is no effective vaccine for it. In recent years, attention has been paid to the role of micronutrients, including vitamin D, in the control and treatment of viral diseases, including dengue fever. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate the role of vitamin D in the treatment and control of dengue fever worldwide using a systematic review method.</p><p>Methods: This study was conducted as a systematic review of the role of vitamin D in the prevention and control of dengue fever globally using a systematic review method. Therefore, all relevant articles were extracted and reviewed through a search in the international scientific databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, WEB OF Science (ISI), and SCOPUS, without a time limit until the end of 2024. The quality of the articles was assessed using the STROB checklist.</p><p>Results: Six articles published between 2018 and 2023 were included in the systematic review process. According to the findings, vitamin D affects macrophages that are differentiated from monocytes and increases resistance to dengue virus. Vitamin D also reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines, transcription, and reduction of mRNA receptors, increases the production of interleukins, especially IL-10, and plays a role in reducing viral load, severity of clinical symptoms, and infection control.</p><p>Conclusion: Vitamin D3 can control the disease and decrease viral load and the severity of dengue fever in patients by inhibiting the inflammatory response and enhancing the immune response. However, given the limited number of studies, it is recommended that more studies be conducted in this field so that this can be discussed with more evidence and accuracy.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/dengue-review-jan-2025.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=peru-declares-a-dengue-emergency---feb-2024>Peru declares a Dengue Emergency - Feb 2024</h4><p><strong><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/peru-declares-health-emergency-dengue-cases-soar/?WT.mc_id=e_DM285774&amp;WT.tsrc=email&amp;etype=Edi_GHS_New_Wed&amp;utmsource=email&amp;utm_medium=Edi_GHS_New_Wed20240228&amp;utm_campaign=DM285774">The Telegraph</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>&ldquo;20 out of 25 regions in Peru have declared a health emergency.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Some <strong>400 million</strong> people are infected with dengue virus each year, according to the World Health Organisation, while at least 100 million are estimated to become ill – a steep rise from the <strong>half a million cases reported in 2000.</strong> "</p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=120000-cases-of-dengue-in-a-brazilian-city-of-28-million---march-2024>120,000 cases of Dengue in a Brazilian city of 2.8 million - March 2024</h4><p><strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/10/dengue-fever-brazil-outbreak-epidemic/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_most&amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3d06bf8%2F65edd446c239dc3fb3b426fe%2F596bdb5f9bbc0f403f990f33%2F18%2F43%2F65edd446c239dc3fb3b426fe">Brazil’s staggering dengue fever crisis is a warning to the world</a> Washington Post</strong></p><ul><li><p>&ldquo;But the disease has surged with particular virulence in Brazil, where epidemiologists expect the number of dengue cases to reach into the millions — more than doubling the previous record — and potentially kill thousands of people.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>" Brazil registered more than 1 million cases of dengue fever in January and February alone.

Vitamin D is a strong immunomodulator affecting both the innate and adaptive immune responses and plays a pivotal role in pathogen-defense mechanisms. There has been considerable interest in the possible role of vitamin D in dengue viral (DENV) infection. In the present prospective cross-sectional study, we assessed a possible association between serum vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and susceptibility towards severe dengue fever (DF) illness. Serum vitamin D levels were measured at the time of hospitalization in 97 patients diagnosed with dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) at Mayo Hospital, King Edward Medical University, Lahore, PK, from 16 November 2021 to 15 January 2022. In terms of disease severity, 37 (38.1%) patients were DF, 52 (53.6%) were DHF grade 1 and 2, and 8 (8.2%) were DSS. The results revealed that most patients (75 (77.3%)) were vitamin-D-deficient (i.e., serum level &lt; 20 ng/mL), including 27 (73.0%) in DF, 41 (78.8%) in DHF grade 1 and 2, and 7 (87.5%) in DSS. The degree of VDD was somewhat higher in DSS patients as compared to DF and DHF grade 1 and 2 patients. Overall, serum vitamin D levels ranged from 4.2 to 109.7 ng/mL, and the median (IQR) was in the VDD range, i.e., 12.2 (9.1, 17.8) ng/mL. Our results suggest that there may be a possible association between VDD and susceptibility towards severe dengue illness. Hence, maintaining sufficient vitamin D levels in the body either through diet or supplementation may help provide adequate immune protection against severe dengue fever illness. Further research is warranted</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/dengue-fever-lahore.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h5 id=review-of-micronutrients-and-dengue---including-the-above-rct>Review of micronutrients and Dengue - including the above RCT</h5><p><strong>Micronutrient Supplementation and Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Dengue Fever</strong></p><p>Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2021 Jan; 104(1): 45–51 2020 Nov <a href=https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0731>doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.20-0731</a></p><p>Steven D. Langerman and Mija Ververs*</p><p><strong>Abtract</strong> Dengue fever (DF) is a viral infection that is common in tropical countries and represents a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality. Despite its prevalence and severity, treatment options for DF remain limited and consist primarily of supportive measures. Several recent studies have concluded that micronutrient supplementation may improve clinical outcomes in patients with DF, but no review has summarized and synthesized these findings. We conducted a literature review to identify articles investigating the effect of micronutrient supplementation on clinical outcomes among patients with DF.</p><p>We found several studies which indicated that supplemental</p><ul><li><p>vitamin C,</p></li><li><p><strong>vitamin D,</strong></p></li><li><p>vitamin E, and</p></li><li><p>zinc</p></li></ul><p>may be useful adjuncts in DF treatment. Folic acid supplementation did not appear to affect clinical outcomes. The reviewed studies have significant limitations including small sample sizes and limited data about the baseline nutritional status of study subjects.

Patients were randomized either to receive a single dose of 200,000 international units of vitamin D (n = 62) in addition to standard care, or to receive standard care only (n = 62).

Although DENV pathogenesis has not yet been fully elucidated, the inflammatory response is a hallmark feature in severe DENV infection. Although vitamin D (vitD) can promote the innate immune response against virus infection, no studies have evaluated the effects of vitD on DENV infection, dendritic cells (DCs), and inflammatory response regulation. This study aimed to assess the impact of oral vitD supplementation on DENV-2 infection, Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression, and both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production in monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). To accomplish this, 20 healthy donors were randomly divided into two groups and received either 1000 or 4000 international units (IU)/day of vitD for 10 days. During pre- and post-vitD supplementation, peripheral blood samples were taken to obtain MDDCs, which were challenged with DENV-2. We found that MDDCs from donors who received 4000 IU/day of vitD were less susceptible to DENV-2 infection than MDDCs from donors who received 1000 IU/day of vitD. Moreover, these cells showed decreased mRNA expression of TLR3, 7, and 9; downregulation of IL-12/IL-8 production; and increased IL-10 secretion in response to DENV-2 infection. In conclusion, the administration of 4000 IU/day of vitD decreased DENV-2 infection. Our findings support a possible role of vitD in improving the innate immune response against DENV. However, further studies are necessary to determine the role of vitD on DENV replication and its innate immune response modulation in MDDCs.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/dengue-4-000-iu-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from Sci-Hub via VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=wikipedia-viral-infections-most-are-preventedtreated-by-vitamin-d>Wikipedia Viral Infections (most are prevented/treated by Vitamin D)</h4><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/viral-wikipedia.jpg alt=image width=600><hr><h4 id=why-singapore-is-on-alert-for-a-record-breaking-year-of-disease-dengue-jan-2023>Why Singapore is on alert for a record-breaking year of disease (Dengue) Jan 2023</h4><p><strong><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/why-singapore-alert-record-breaking-year-disease/?WT.mc_id=e_DM100541&amp;WT.tsrc=email&amp;etype=Edi_GHS_New_Tue&amp;utmsource=email&amp;utm_medium=Edi_GHS_New_Tue20230131&amp;utm_campaign=DM100541">The Telegraph</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>" 2022 &ldquo;total cases last year were almost six times higher than in 2021 – with 32,000 recorded.

Chakravarti. T. Bharara, N. Kapoor</p><p>Background: Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is coded by VDR gene located on chromosome 12. The present study was undertaken to decipher the effect of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism on dengue disease outcome, as there is a dearth of similar studies in the context of Indian population.</p><p>Methods and materials: The study was conducted in the Virology Laboratory, Department of Microbiology, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi. We studied 100 cases (suspected dengue patients) and 100 healthy controls over a period of 1 year (January 2014 to December 2014). Revised WHO guidelines (2009) were followed to define and characterize a case of dengue. Peripheral venous samples were collected for diagnosis of dengue (NS1 antigen, IgM and IgG antibody). Genomic DNA was extracted from patients and healthy controls and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism was done for detection of VDRL gene polymorphism (start codon rs2228570 and 3′ UTR, rs7975232). Data was analysed using SPSS software (version 17.0). A p value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p>Results: VDR gene polymorphism (rs 2228570 and rs 7975232) was screened in the samples. Genotype C/C, C/T and T/T (rs 2228570) was found in 11 (25.58%), 18 (41.9%) and 14 (32.6%) dengue positive cases and 59%, 25% and 16% healthy controls respectively (p = 0.001, significant). Significant association of the T allele of rs 2228570 polymorphism in a dominant mode of inheritance (C/T + T/T genotype) was seen with severe dengue cases <a href="OR%20of%203.86%20(1.59%E2%80%939.35),%20p%E2%80%85=%E2%80%850.002%20for%20C/T%20and%204.69%20(1.79%E2%80%9312.3),%20p%E2%80%85=%E2%80%850.001%20for%20T/T%20genotypes">OR of 3.86 (1.59–9.35), p = 0.002 for C/T and 4.69 (1.79–12.3), p = 0.001 for T/T genotypes</a>.</p><p>Genotypes A/A, A/C and C/C (rs 7975232) were found in</p><ul><li><p>34.9%, 55.8%, 9.3% dengue positive cases and</p></li><li><p>31%, 40%, 29% healthy controls respectively.</p></li></ul><p>While comparing the A/A with A/C and C/C genotypes among dengue cases and healthy controls, the OR was estimated to be 1.24 (0.55–2.75, p > 0.05) and 0.28 (0.08–0.96, p &lt; 0.05) respectively.

Smith</p><p>Infections with the mosquito-transmitted dengue virus (DENV) are a pressing public health problem in many parts of the world. The recently released commercial vaccine for DENV has encountered some problems, and there is still no effective drug to treat infections. Vitamin D has a well characterized role in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, but additionally has a role in the immune response to bacterial and viral pathogens. In this study a number of fused bicyclic derivatives of 1H-pyrrolo<sup>[1,2]</sup>imidazol-1-one with vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonist activity were evaluated for possible anti-DENV activity. The results showed that five of the compounds were able to significantly inhibit DENV infection. The most effective compound, ZD-3, had an EC50 value of 7.47 μM and a selective index of 52.75. The compounds were only effective when used as a post-infection treatment and treatment significantly reduced levels of infection, virus output, DENV protein expression and genome copy number. These results suggest that these VDR agonists have the potential for future development as effective anti-DENV agents.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/vdr-dengue-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>blood levels</span>
