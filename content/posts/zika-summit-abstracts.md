Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family transmitted to humans by mosquito bites and sexual route. ZIKV caused a major outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013/2014 and has since spread in 2015 to the Americas, notably in Brazil. Most cases of zika infection in otherwise healthy adults are asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic, with fever, rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis. ZIKV infection has recently been associated with severe fetopathy, including microcephaly (Brasil et al., N Engl J Med. 2016, in press). Placental calcifications are observed in ZIKV-infected pregnant women and the virus is also present in the amniotic fluid and brain of fetuses with microcephaly (Calvet et al., Lancet Infect. Dis., 2016, in press; Mlakar et al., N Engl J Med. 2016, in press; Sarno et al., PLOS Negl Trop Dis, 2016).

Together, these data strongly suggest that ZIKV has ability to cross the placental barrier and induce fetopathy.

Here, we have assessed the ability of ZIKV to infect human placental explants and human trophoblast cell lines, as compared to Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), another emerging arbovirus which is not able to infect the placenta and is exclusively transmitted vertically from viremic mother to their baby during parturition via placental breaches. We infected third trimester human placental explants with either ZIKV or CHIKV, and viral load in placental tissues and supernatants were determined daily from day 1 to day 4 post-infection. We found that ZIKV replicates in human placental explants, as shown by viral titers in placental tissues and supernatants, while, as expected, CHIKV does not. The identification of the cells targeted by ZIKV in human placental explants is currently investigated. In addition, a human trophoblast cell line was shown to be susceptible to ZIKV infection, but resistant to CHIKV infection. These preliminary data suggest a direct ZIKV tropism for human placenta. The relevance of these results will be assessed by detection of ZIKV in human placental biopsies of infected pregnant women. Studies in animal models susceptible to ZIKV will help to decipher how and when this virus crosses the placental barrier.

Deciphering the placental phase of ZIKV infection is required to understand its vertical transmission and develop potential preventive and therapeutic strategies against this emerging teratogenic arbovirus.

Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in Brazil, was first described in 2015 and it overlapped with a significant increase in number of cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults and also in neurological malformation in infants, including microcephaly. The role of the immune response in protection and/or development of severe cases of infectionremain to be addressed. This proposal aims to evaluate both the innate and acquired immune response in patients with different clinical forms of the infection. Especially seeks to identify specific immune signatures to different clinical forms of the disease and, in addition, assess whether there are  **cross-reactivities to virus chikungunya and dengue (DENV).**  To this, a consortium gatheringclinical investigators (Department of Bahia State Health), virologists (Federal University of Bahia), immunologists (Fiocruz, Bahia) and molecular biologists and immunologists (Departement d'lmmunologie Hopitaux Universitaires Pitie- Salpetriere, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie - France) is being formed. The lymphocyte responses to ZIKV peptides and recombinant proteins as well as the innate immune cell responsesto the virus will be evaluated using different methodologies, including mass cytometry (CyTOF) that simultaneously analyzes up to 30 parameters in a single tube. Antibodies from ZIKV-infected individuals will be evaluated in relation to antigenic specificity, neutralizing capacity andcross-reactivity with DENV-4 and chikungunya virus antigens. The results of this project would contribute to the understanding of pathogenesis of the disease, in addition to the characterization of dominant immune response that will be important for the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines and identification of potential drug targets.

—Background Zika virus (ZIKV) has been linked to neonatal microcephaly. To characterize the spectrum of ZIKV disease in pregnancy, we followed patients in Rio de Janeiro to describe clinical manifestations in mothers and repercussions of acute ZIKV infection in fetuses. Methods We enrolled pregnant women in whom a rash had developed within the previous 5 days and tested blood and urine specimens for ZIKV by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays. We followed the women prospectively and collected clinical and ultrasonographic data. Results A total of 88 women were enrolled from September 2015 through February 2016; of these 88 women, 72 (82%) tested positive for ZIKV in blood, urine, or both. The timing of acute ZIKV infection ranged from 5 to 38 weeks of gestation. Predominant clinical features included pruritic descending macular or maculopapular rash, arthralgias, conjunctival injection, and headache; 28% had fever (short-term and low-grade). Women who were positive for ZIKV were more likely than those who were negative for the virus to have maculopapular rash (44% vs. 12%, P=0.02), conjunctival involvement (58% vs. 13%, P=0.002), and lymphadenopathy (40% vs. 7%, P=0.02). Fetal ultrasonography was performed in 42 ZIKV-positive women (58%) and in all ZIKV-negative women. Fetal abnormalities were detected by Doppler ultrasonography in 12 of the 42 ZIKV-positive women (29%) and in none of the 16 ZIKV-negative women. Adverse findings included fetal deaths at 36 and 38 weeks of gestation (2 fetuses), in utero growth restriction with or without microcephaly (5 fetuses), ventricular calcifications or other central nervous system (CNS) lesions (7 fetuses), and abnormal amniotic fluid volume or cerebral or umbilical artery flow (7 fetuses). To date, 8 of the 42 women in whom fetal ultrasonography was performed have delivered their babies, and the ultrasonographic findings have been confirmed. Conclusions Despite mild clinical symptoms, ZIKV infection during pregnancy appears to be associated with grave outcomes, including fetal death, placental insufficiency, fetal growth restriction, and CNS injury.

On May 2015 an outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) was identified in Brazil. Zika virus infection has been linked to neurological disorders like microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome in Brazil and in other countries. Despite that, hearing impairment and pray-motor skills were not described. Here we report three cases admitted in the Emergency Unit with hearing loss, tinnitus and dizziness. All patients reported acute symptoms of itching exanthema, arthralgia and headache. Audiometry exams were performed before, during and after otologic symptoms in two patients and revealed temporary bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. A positive serologic test confirmed ZIKV infection in all patients. Our finding suggests a possibly association between Zika virus infection and acute hearing loss, which may persist for up to four weeks.

The emergence of Zika virus in the Americas with its untoward impact on the developing fetus is resulting in a rapid response by the scientific and public health communities. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) responded by activating its Emergency Operations Center on January 22, 2016. Given the paucity of data specific to how the virus impacts the fetus, CDC has a launched a number of surveillance and research projects in the U.S. and with collaborators in other countries. On the domestic front, CDC has implemented the U.S. Zika Pregnancy Registry, an active surveillance network to prospectively enroll and follow pregnant women and their infants; a complementary registry has also been implemented in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Both systems enroll pregnant women and infants with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection, and prenatally and perinatally exposed infants. Individuals are enrolled into the registry by health departments or directly from health care providers. In Puerto Rico active surveillance is underway based on medical record abstraction. Data on the pregnant women will be collected at a number of points in pregnancy and on the infants at birth and at 2, 6, and 12 months of age, with follow-up to age 3 years in Puerto Rico. Clinical information will include attributes of the mother’s health and Zika virus testing during pregnancy, results of fetal and newborn evaluations, and medical and developmental information on the infant. Emerging data from the registries will be used to inform clinical recommendations and public health actions. CDC is also enhancing its ongoing state-based birth defects surveillance programs to identify, in a real-time manner, any infant born with microcephaly or other Zika-related birth defects. In the international arena, CDC is engaged in several research and surveillance activities in Central and South America. Most notably, we are collaborating with the Secretary of Health of Paraiba state, Brazil and the Brazilian Ministry of Health on a case-control study of microcephaly to further characterize the association with Zika virus infection and the clinical phenotype of fetal Zika infection. We are also collaborating with the Instituto Nacional de Salud in Colombia to enhance their national surveillance of Zika virus disease among pregnant women and to implement in-depth monitoring of pregnant women in selected regions of Colombia with high reported incidence of Zika virus disease. A description of CDC activities and collaborations will be presented, including current status and anticipated outcomes.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus which can cause severe neurological disorders, spreading rapidly through the America, a public health emergency of international concern. Current diagnostic tests are inadequate, expensive and unavailable where they are needed most. We propose to develop, optimize and deploy an affordable, reliable, easy to use, rapid, and robust kit for rural and low-income use for the detection of arboviruses, both on human samples for diagnosis as well as on mosquitoes for surveillance purposes. The kit will utilize isothermal amplification techniques coupled to a smartphone app and sensor to collect and disseminate acquired data, providing new types of useful data for infectious disease monitoring, modeling, and prediction. Kit will be widely deployed, including to communities and schools, for vector surveillance, public engagement, and educational purposes.
