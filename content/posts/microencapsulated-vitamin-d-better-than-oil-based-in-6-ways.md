#### Benefits of using a microencapsulated vitamin D delivery system in women with polycystic ovary syndrome - Sept 2023

Eur J Hosp Pharm. 2023 Sep;30(5):284-287. [doi: 10.1136/ejhpharm-2021-002967](https://doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2021-002967)

Objective: To compare and assess the efficacy of two vitamin D delivery systems (oil-based and microencapsulated) on 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance (IR) in women with established polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and vitamin D deficiency.

Materials and methods: A monocentric, retrospective study was conducted, using the data of 70 female patients, who visited the endocrinology department of the "Dr. Shterev" Hospital, Sofia, Bulgaria between May 2020 and September 2020. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of vitamin D3 supplementation: either a microencapsulated liposomal form (n=35), or a conventional oil-based form (n=35). The following clinical measures were analysed and compared: BMI, serum levels of 25(OH)D, fasting plasma glucose levels, fasting immunoreactive insulin (IRI), homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index, levels of antimullerian hormone (AMH) II generation, and testosterone. In all selected patients, these measurements were performed at baseline and 3 months after initiation of vitamin D supplementation.

Results:  **Significantly increased serum levels of 25(OH)D**  were observed in patients supplemented with the microencapsulated form of vitamin D3 in the third month from the beginning of therapy, compared with the control group (p=0.003). 

In the microencapsulated vitamin D group, there was a decrease in 

*  **IRI serum levels**  (p=0.023), 

*  **HOMA-IR**  (p=0.021), 

*  **serum AMH**  (p=0.010) and 

*  **testosterone levels**  (p=0.006). 

The fasting plasma glucose levels did not change significantly.

Conclusion: The results of our study show that the patients supplemented with a microencapsulated%%% form of vitamin D3 achieved  **faster compensation of 25(OH)D levels** , which in turn, under equal conditions, led to significant improvement in the metabolic profile, in particular insulin sensitivity.

 **Nanoemulsion appears to signicantly improve the CY27A1 gene, thus more D gets into body** 

Scope

Vitamin D (VD) is a fat-soluble vitamin that has a wide range of skeletal and non-skeletal functions. Although it can be synthesized through sun exposure and obtained from fortified foods, VD inadequacy is epidemic worldwide. Therefore innovative strategies are necessary for improving VD status. The present study examined VD absorption via nanoscale delivery systems.

Methods and results

We examine the physical characteristics and in vitro bioaccessibility of cholecalciferol (VD3) in nanoemulsion using a simulated gastrointestinal tract system. To evaluate the in vivo bioavailability, we orally administer three groups of mice with VD3 nanoemulsion, VD3 coarse emulsion, or vehicle nanoemulsion without VD3, and the serum 25(OH)D3 is measured using radioactive immunoassay. The nanoemulsion-based delivery system increases the in vitro bioaccessibility by 3.94-folds (p < 0.05), as indicated by the concentration of vitamin D3 in micelles. Our animal study shows that, when compared to the vehicle group, the coarse emulsion numerically increases the serum 25(OH)D3 by 36%, whereas the nanoemulsion statistically significantly increases the serum 25(OH)D3 by 73% (p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Our findings indicate that a nanoemulsion-based delivery system is a promising approach to improve VD bioavailability, and further studies are warranted to determine its efficacy in humans.

!!!!Benefits of using a microencapsulated vitamin D delivery system in women with polycystic ovary syndrome - Sept 2023

Objective: To compare and assess the efficacy of two vitamin D delivery systems (oil-based and microencapsulated) on 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance (IR) in women with established polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and vitamin D deficiency.

Materials and methods: A monocentric, retrospective study was conducted, using the data of 70 female patients, who visited the endocrinology department of the &quot;Dr. Shterev&quot; Hospital, Sofia, Bulgaria between May 2020 and September 2020. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of vitamin D3 supplementation: either a microencapsulated liposomal form (n=35), or a conventional oil-based form (n=35). The following clinical measures were analysed and compared: BMI, serum levels of 25(OH)D, fasting plasma glucose levels, fasting immunoreactive insulin (IRI), homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index, levels of antimullerian hormone (AMH) II generation, and testosterone. In all selected patients, these measurements were performed at baseline and 3 months after initiation of vitamin D supplementation.

Results: __Significantly increased serum levels of 25(OH)D__ were observed in patients supplemented with the microencapsulated form of vitamin D3 in the third month from the beginning of therapy, compared with the control group (p=0.003). 
In the microencapsulated vitamin D group, there was a decrease in 
*__IRI serum levels__ (p=0.023), 
*__HOMA-IR__ (p=0.021), 
*__serum AMH__ (p=0.010) and 
*__testosterone levels__ (p=0.006). 
The fasting plasma glucose levels did not change significantly.

Conclusion: The results of our study show that the patients supplemented with a microencapsulated%%% form of vitamin D3 achieved __faster compensation of 25(OH)D levels__, which in turn, under equal conditions, led to significant improvement in the metabolic profile, in particular insulin sensitivity.

Scope
Vitamin D (VD) is a fat-soluble vitamin that has a wide range of skeletal and non-skeletal functions. Although it can be synthesized through sun exposure and obtained from fortified foods, VD inadequacy is epidemic worldwide. Therefore innovative strategies are necessary for improving VD status. The present study examined VD absorption via nanoscale delivery systems.

Methods and results
We examine the physical characteristics and in vitro bioaccessibility of cholecalciferol (VD3) in nanoemulsion using a simulated gastrointestinal tract system. To evaluate the in vivo bioavailability, we orally administer three groups of mice with VD3 nanoemulsion, VD3 coarse emulsion, or vehicle nanoemulsion without VD3, and the serum 25(OH)D3 is measured using radioactive immunoassay. The nanoemulsion-based delivery system increases the in vitro bioaccessibility by 3.94-folds (p &lt; 0.05), as indicated by the concentration of vitamin D3 in micelles. Our animal study shows that, when compared to the vehicle group, the coarse emulsion numerically increases the serum 25(OH)D3 by 36%, whereas the nanoemulsion statistically significantly increases the serum 25(OH)D3 by 73% (p &lt; 0.01).

Conclusion
Our findings indicate that a nanoemulsion-based delivery system is a promising approach to improve VD bioavailability, and further studies are warranted to determine its efficacy in humans.
