Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continue to be a major public health problem around the world that frequently presents with microvascular and macrovascular complications. Individuals with T2DM are not only suffering from significant emotional and physical misery, but also at increased risk of dying from severe complications. In recent years, evidence from prospective observational studies and clinical trials has shown T2DM risk reduction with vitamin K2 supplementation. We thus did an overview of currently available studies to assess the effect of vitamin K2 supplementation on insulin sensitivity, glycaemic control and reviewed the underlying mechanisms. We proposed that vitamin K2 improved insulin sensitivity through involvement of vitamin K-dependent-protein osteocalcin, anti-inflammatory properties, and lipid-lowering effects. Vitamin K2 had a better effect than vitamin K1 on T2DM. The interpretation of this review will increase comprehension of the development of a therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat T2DM.

Introduction

T2DM manifests when pancreatic β-cells fail to compensate for chronic elevated blood glucose (hyperglycemia) that occurs when glucose uptake in the insulin-sensitive tissues become imbalanced during insulin resistance. Insulin resistance, a state that precedes T2DM, is one of the major sign of pathogenesis and etiology of T2DM. It is becoming increasingly obvious that chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation attends obesity, and insulin resistance leads to the progression from obesity to T2DM. T2DM frequently presents with microvascular and macrovascular complications, lead to long-term damage, malfunction and failure of various organs and systems, especially the eyes, kidneys, nervous and cardiovascular systems. Importantly, it has been considered as a strong, independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases that accounts for approximately 70% of all mortality in patients with diabetes. If patients fail to maintain normal blood glucose levels, the long-term complications will impose significant emotional or physical burdens on patients, family and society.

In recent years, evidence from prospective observational studies and clinical trials has shown T2DM risk reduction with vitamin K supplementation. Vitamins are vital micronutrients that the organism cannot synthesize sufficient quantity and obtained mainly from diet. Henrik Dam, who later shared the 1943 Nobel Prize in medicine with Edward Doisy for their work on vitamin K, in 1935, discovered a fat soluble factor with similar physical properties to vitamin E but different physiological clotting function from any known vitamin. Dam called this new factor “the anti-hemorrhagic vitamin” which finally got the name “vitamin K” based on the Scandinavian and German spelling of ‘‘Koagulations’’ <sup>[1]</sup>. Vitamin K also functions as a cofactor for γ-glutamyl carboxylase which is essential for the conversion of glutamate (Glu) residues to γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla). Two vitamin K- dependent-proteins, osteocalcin and matrix-Gla protein, present in skeletal and vascular system, and vitamin K has been reported plays a role in cardiovascular system and skeletal health <sup>[2]</sup>.

Vitamin K exists mainly in two biologically active forms: vitamin K1 (also known as phylloquinone) and vitamin K2 (also known as menaquinone). Vitamin K1 is naturally produced by plants and most abundant in green leafy vegetables <sup>[3]</sup>. Vitamin K2 is predominantly found in meat, eggs, curd, cheese, and fermented soybeans (natto). In addition, bacteria in human intestine also synthesize menaquinone. Menaquinones are abbreviated as MK-n where M represents menaquinone, K represents vitamin K, and n stands for the number of isoprenoid side chain length <sup>[4]</sup>.

The importance of vitamin K2 for osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease is well-recongnized <sup>[5]</sup>, <sup>[6]</sup>, and there are some suggestions of a role for vitamin K2 in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing T2DM risk <sup>[7]</sup>, <sup>[8]</sup>. Here we provided an overview of currently available studies to assess the effect of vitamin K2 supplementation on insulin sensitivity, glycaemic control and review the underlying mechanisms. We proposed that vitamin K2 improved insulin sensitivity through involvement of vitamin K-dependent-protein osteocalcin, anti-inflammatory properties, and lipid-lowering effects. Vitamin K2 had a better effect than vitamin K1 on T2DM. The interpretation of this review will promote the development of a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat T2DM.

Vitamin K2 reduces the risk of T2DM

Beulens et al. examined the associations of dietary phylloquinone and menaquinone intakes with the risk of T2DM in a large samples of 38,094 Dutch men and women (20–70 y) in prospective cohort study. Dietary phylloquinone and menaquinone intakes were analyzed by using a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). It had been observed that menaquinone intake tended to be inversely associated with risk of T2DM with an Hazard Ratio of 0.95 for each 10-μg increment (P = .060). In the final multivariate...

Osteocalcin is a vitamin K- dependent protein

Vitamin K shares the common structure, 2-methyl-1,4-napthoquinone, functioning as a cofactor for the enzyme, γ-glutamate carboxylase (GGCX) which is essential for vitamin K-dependent-protein to convert glutamate to γ-carboxyglutamic (Gla) residues. Osteocalcin is a kind of vitamin K-dependent–protein and synthesized by osteoblasts. It contains a propeptide recognition site that is essential for binding to GGCX and undergoes an unusual post-translational modification. After carboxylation, the...

The effect of different forms of vitamin K on T2DM

As for the effect of different forms of vitamin K on T2DM, results from Beulens et al. <sup>[8]</sup> showed that in an age-, sex-, and waist-adjusted model, vitamin K1 intake was not associated with risk of T2DM with an HR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.97–1.03) for each 50-μg increment, whereas vitamin K2 intake tended to be inversely associated (P = .060) with risk of T2DM with an HR of 0.95 (95% CI 0.91–1.01) for each 10-μg increment. And Spline regression showed evidence of a nonlinear relation (P = .053) between ...

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continue to be a major public health problem around the world that frequently presents with microvascular and macrovascular complications. Individuals with T2DM are not only suffering from significant emotional and physical misery, but also at increased risk of dying from severe complications. In recent years, evidence from prospective observational studies and clinical trials has shown T2DM risk reduction with vitamin K2 supplementation. We thus did an overview of currently available studies to assess the effect of vitamin K2 supplementation on insulin sensitivity, glycaemic control and reviewed the underlying mechanisms. We proposed that vitamin K2 improved insulin sensitivity through involvement of vitamin K-dependent-protein osteocalcin, anti-inflammatory properties, and lipid-lowering effects. Vitamin K2 had a better effect than vitamin K1 on T2DM. The interpretation of this review will increase comprehension of the development of a therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat T2DM.

Introduction
T2DM manifests when pancreatic β-cells fail to compensate for chronic elevated blood glucose (hyperglycemia) that occurs when glucose uptake in the insulin-sensitive tissues become imbalanced during insulin resistance. Insulin resistance, a state that precedes T2DM, is one of the major sign of pathogenesis and etiology of T2DM. It is becoming increasingly obvious that chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation attends obesity, and insulin resistance leads to the progression from obesity to T2DM. T2DM frequently presents with microvascular and macrovascular complications, lead to long-term damage, malfunction and failure of various organs and systems, especially the eyes, kidneys, nervous and cardiovascular systems. Importantly, it has been considered as a strong, independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases that accounts for approximately 70% of all mortality in patients with diabetes. If patients fail to maintain normal blood glucose levels, the long-term complications will impose significant emotional or physical burdens on patients, family and society.

In recent years, evidence from prospective observational studies and clinical trials has shown T2DM risk reduction with vitamin K supplementation. Vitamins are vital micronutrients that the organism cannot synthesize sufficient quantity and obtained mainly from diet. Henrik Dam, who later shared the 1943 Nobel Prize in medicine with Edward Doisy for their work on vitamin K, in 1935, discovered a fat soluble factor with similar physical properties to vitamin E but different physiological clotting function from any known vitamin. Dam called this new factor “the anti-hemorrhagic vitamin” which finally got the name “vitamin K” based on the Scandinavian and German spelling of ‘‘Koagulations’’ [1]. Vitamin K also functions as a cofactor for γ-glutamyl carboxylase which is essential for the conversion of glutamate (Glu) residues to γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla). Two vitamin K- dependent-proteins, osteocalcin and matrix-Gla protein, present in skeletal and vascular system, and vitamin K has been reported plays a role in cardiovascular system and skeletal health [2].

Vitamin K exists mainly in two biologically active forms: vitamin K1 (also known as phylloquinone) and vitamin K2 (also known as menaquinone). Vitamin K1 is naturally produced by plants and most abundant in green leafy vegetables [3]. Vitamin K2 is predominantly found in meat, eggs, curd, cheese, and fermented soybeans (natto). In addition, bacteria in human intestine also synthesize menaquinone. Menaquinones are abbreviated as MK-n where M represents menaquinone, K represents vitamin K, and n stands for the number of isoprenoid side chain length [4].

The importance of vitamin K2 for osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease is well-recongnized [5], [6], and there are some suggestions of a role for vitamin K2 in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing T2DM risk [7], [8]. Here we provided an overview of currently available studies to assess the effect of vitamin K2 supplementation on insulin sensitivity, glycaemic control and review the underlying mechanisms. We proposed that vitamin K2 improved insulin sensitivity through involvement of vitamin K-dependent-protein osteocalcin, anti-inflammatory properties, and lipid-lowering effects. Vitamin K2 had a better effect than vitamin K1 on T2DM. The interpretation of this review will promote the development of a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat T2DM.

Section snippets
Vitamin K2 reduces the risk of T2DM
Beulens et al. examined the associations of dietary phylloquinone and menaquinone intakes with the risk of T2DM in a large samples of 38,094 Dutch men and women (20–70 y) in prospective cohort study. Dietary phylloquinone and menaquinone intakes were analyzed by using a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). It had been observed that menaquinone intake tended to be inversely associated with risk of T2DM with an Hazard Ratio of 0.95 for each 10-μg increment (P = .060). In the final multivariate...

Osteocalcin is a vitamin K- dependent protein
Vitamin K shares the common structure, 2-methyl-1,4-napthoquinone, functioning as a cofactor for the enzyme, γ-glutamate carboxylase (GGCX) which is essential for vitamin K-dependent-protein to convert glutamate to γ-carboxyglutamic (Gla) residues. Osteocalcin is a kind of vitamin K-dependent–protein and synthesized by osteoblasts. It contains a propeptide recognition site that is essential for binding to GGCX and undergoes an unusual post-translational modification. After carboxylation, the...

The effect of different forms of vitamin K on T2DM
As for the effect of different forms of vitamin K on T2DM, results from Beulens et al. [8] showed that in an age-, sex-, and waist-adjusted model, vitamin K1 intake was not associated with risk of T2DM with an HR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.97–1.03) for each 50-μg increment, whereas vitamin K2 intake tended to be inversely associated (P = .060) with risk of T2DM with an HR of 0.95 (95% CI 0.91–1.01) for each 10-μg increment. And Spline regression showed evidence of a nonlinear relation (P = .053) between ...
