The HPV vaccine is given in two doses if the series is started before the age of 15, or three doses if started at age 15 or older. The meningococcal vaccine is also given in multiple doses, with the MenACWY vaccine typically given at 11 or 12 years old and again at 16 years old, and the MenB vaccine recommended under specific circumstances
