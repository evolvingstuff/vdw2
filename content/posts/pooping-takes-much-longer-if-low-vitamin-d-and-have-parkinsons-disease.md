#### Low Serum Vitamin D Levels May Contribute to Gastric Dysmotility in de novo Parkinson's Disease.

14 seconds No PD

19 seconds PD, not low vitamin D

33 seconds PD and associated with low Vitamin D

* Wonder if  poop-time is also increased for those with low D but without PD?

* Note: The most constipation I have had in my life occured when I was taking lots of vitamin D but had not yet added Magnesium

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:

Gastrointestinal dysfunction is a common non motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the potential association between vitamin D and gastroparesis in PD has not been previously investigated. The aim of this study was to compare vitamin D levels between drug-naive de novo PD patients with normal gastric emptying and those with delayed gastric emptying.

METHODS:

Fifty-one patients with drug-naive de novo PD and 20 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Gastric emptying time (GET) was assessed by scintigraphy, and gastric emptying half-time (T1/2) was determined. The PD patients were divided into a delayed-GET group and a normal-GET group.

RESULTS:

The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels were decreased in the delayed-GET group compared with the normal-GET and control groups (11.59 ± 4.90 vs. 19.43 ± 6.91 and 32.69 ± 4.93, respectively, p < 0.01). In the multivariate model, the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 level was independently associated with delayed gastric emptying in PD patients.

CONCLUSIONS:

Vitamin D status may be an independent factor for gastric dysmotility in PD. Although the underlying mechanism remains to be characterized, vitamin D status may play a role in the pathogenesis of delayed gastric emptying in drug-naive PD.
