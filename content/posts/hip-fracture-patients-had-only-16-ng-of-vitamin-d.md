BACKGROUND:

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is used as an index that reflects the level of vitamin D. We have previously reported, on the basis of a study in Sado in Niigata, that patients with hip fracture have lower serum 25(OH)D levels than non-hip-fracture cases. In this study, the serum 25(OH)D status in hip-fracture cases was examined in four regions in Japan. Although most hip-fracture patients have experienced past spine-compression fractures, the relationship of these fractures and 25(OH)D is unknown. Therefore, we also examined the 25(OH)D level in spine-compression fracture patients in the same locations and time periods.

METHODS:

The levels of 25(OH)D, intact parathyroid hormone (intact PTH), undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC), urine N-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX), and bone mineral density were examined in patients with hip and spine fracture due to osteoporosis in several regions in Japan.

RESULTS:

There were no significant differences in age, BMI, serum 25(OH)D, serum intact PTH, and serum ucOC among the regions. Levels of serum 25(OH)D were low in patients with hip fracture and spine fracture. The average serum 25(OH)D level was significantly lower in hip-fracture patients than in spine-fracture patients (16.3 vs. 18.1 ng/mL, P < 0.05). High serum ucOC was found in 37% of hip-fracture patients and 44% of spine-fracture patients.

CONCLUSIONS:

Both hip and spine-fracture patients have vitamin D insufficiency, with similar results found in elderly patients in four areas of Japan. The severity of this condition tends to be more serious in hip-fracture patients than in spine-fracture patients.
