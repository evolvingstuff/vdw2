PURPOSE:

Vitamin D deficiency is a potential risk factor for cardiometabolic disease. We investigated the associations between vitamin D and dyslipidemia and the metabolic syndrome in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a group at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

METHODS:

Serum 25(OH)vitamin D and lipoprotein levels were measured at baseline in a random sample of 499 participants, ages 18-85 years, enrolled in a randomized trial of golimumab (GOlimumab Before Employing methotrexate as the First-line Option in the treatment of Rheumatoid arthritis of Early onset or GO-BEFORE Trial). Participants had rheumatoid arthritis with active disease, and were naïve to methotrexate and biologic therapies. Multivariable linear regression was performed to assess associations between vitamin D levels and lipoprotein fractions. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the odds of hyperlipidemia and the metabolic syndrome in participants with vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL).

RESULTS:

In multivariable linear regression, vitamin D levels (per 10 ng/mL) were associated inversely with low-density lipoprotein (β: -0.029 <span>[-0.049, -0.0091]</span>, P=.004) and triglyceride (β: -0.094 <span>[-0.15, -0.039]</span> P=.001) levels, adjusted for demographic, cardiovascular, and disease-specific variables. Vitamin D and high-density lipoprotein levels were not associated in univariate or multivariate analyses. 

Vitamin D deficiency was associated independently with an increased odds of hyperlipidemia (odds ratio 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.45; P=.014) and metabolic syndrome (odds ratio 3.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.75-6.80; P <.001) in adjusted models.

CONCLUSIONS:

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency was associated with the metabolic syndrome and dyslipidemia in rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting a potential role in cardiovascular disease risk. Large-scale, prospective studies are needed to determine if vitamin D supplementation improves lipoprotein levels and reduces cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis.
