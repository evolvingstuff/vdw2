### [NHS](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vitamins-minerals/Pages/Vitamin-D.aspx%20) statement

* If you take vitamin D supplements, do not take more than 25 micrograms (0.025mg) a day, as it could be harmful. 

> However, taking less than this is unlikely to cause any harm.

* Taking too many vitamin D supplements over a long period of time can cause more calcium to be absorbed than can be excreted. 

* The excess calcium can be deposited in and damage the kidneys. 

* Excessive intake of vitamin D can also encourage calcium to be removed from bones, which can soften and weaken them.

#### Yes, if you do not balance your <a href="/posts/cofactors" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1270">cofactors</a> there can be problems.

* Vitamin D is NOT a monotherapy

* Must reduce Calcium to 500 mg, Increase Magneium to 500 mg, and add Vitamin K2 to keep any excess Calcium from depositing in the arteries, etc.

* By the way: 2013 study found that Vitamin D does NOT cause kidney stones.
