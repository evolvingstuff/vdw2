#### RSV 11.8 X more likely to be life-threatening if low Vitamin D – Feb 2022

 **Serum Vitamin D Levels and Life-Threatening Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in Previously Healthy Infants** 

J Infect Dis. 2022 Feb 1;jiac033. [doi: 10.1093/infdis/jiac033](https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiac033) $28 PDF

Background: 25-hydroxyvitamin D (VD) effects on lung function and immune-modulation might affect RSV infection outcomes. We aimed to assess serum VD levels on admission and their association to  **life-RSV 11X more likely to be life threatening disease (LTD)** 

in previously healthy infants hospitalized with RSV.

Methods: Prospective cohort study conducted during 2017-2019. Previously healthy infants <12 months, hospitalized with a first episode of RSV infection, were enrolled. LTD was defined by the need of intensive care and ventilatory support. Serum VD levels <20 ng/ml were categorized as deficient, and between 20-29.9 ng/ml as insufficient.

Results: 125 patients were studied, 73 (58%) were male. The median age was 4 months (interquartile range <span>[IQR]</span>) 2-6). Twenty-two patients developed LTD. No differences were seen in viral load of cases with LTD compared to those with better outcome (P=.94). 

Patients with LTD had significantly lower VD levels: median 18.4 ng/ml (IQR 15.1-26.9 ng/ml) versus 31.7 ng/ml (IQR 23.6-42.0 ng/ml), P<.001;  **59% of all infants with LTD had VD levels <20 ng/ml, compared with a frequency of 12% in those with better outcome** . Multivariable regression analysis confirmed VD deficiency as a risk factor for  **LTD (OR 11.83** , 95%CI 3.89-35.9, P<.001).

Conclusions: These findings provide additional evidence for the development of preventive strategies.

* For healthy people, RSV feels like a cold.

   * Its symptoms can be indistinguishable from the flu, except for the fact that RSV is less likely than the flu to cause fever.

#### Serum 25-hydroxy Vitamin D Levels in Japanese Infants Younger Than 3-months Old With Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection - July 2020

Low levels of blood vitamin D have been reported in children who have frequent respiratory tract infections. We measured serum concentrations of 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D in Japanese infants less than 3-months old infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Serum levels of 25-OH vitamin D of the 10 infants, excluding those with underlying diseases, were between less than 4 to 29.8 ng/mL. In 8 out of 10 subjects (80.0%), serum 25-OH vitamin D levels were less than 20 ng/mL. There was no statistically significant association between levels of 25-OH vitamin D and age, duration of admission, respiratory severity score, white blood cell count, blood gas levels, and NT-proBNP levels. Levels of serum 25-OH vitamin D in children who required hospitalization owing to RSV infection were low, indicating deficiency. These results suggested that vitamin D deficiency affects the susceptibility to RSV infection, but not the severity of the RSV respiratory infection.

#### 4.5X more Oxygen for Viral Respiratory Illness in Infants if low vitamin D - 2017

 **Inverse Correlation between 25-OH Vitamin D Levels and Severity of Viral Respiratory Illness in Infants** 

Journal of Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology 2017, 3:030 DOI: 10.23937/2474-3658/1510030

Background: 25-OH vitamin D levels above 30 ng/mL activate HCAP-18, which impacts the immune response to respiratory viruses. While emerging data suggests a link between low levels of 25-OH vitamin D and an increased incidence of respiratory infections, the relationship between these levels and severity of infection is unknown. We hypothesized that infants with insufficient 25-OH vitamin D levels would have more severe viral respiratory infections.

Methods: Healthy infants admitted with fever and cough or congestion were prospectively enrolled and 25-OH vitamin D levels were measured. Presumptive bacterial infections were excluded. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected for determination of viral etiology by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Demographics and severity markers were recorded. Levels were categorized as sufficient (> 30 ng/ mL), or insufficient (< 30 ng/mL).

Results: We enrolled 90 subjects. 25-OH vitamin D was < 30 ng/mL in 66%. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common virus. On multivariable analysis, breastfeeding was the only risk factor found to be associated with insufficiency. Administration of antibiotics and intravenous fluid, and PICU admission were not significantly different in infants with insufficient levels. However, infants with insufficient vitamin D had increased durations of both 

* hospitalization (1.4 days, 95% Confidence interval (CI) = 1.0-1.9 days) and 

* oxygen use (2.2 days, 95% CI = 1.4-3.5 days), and used a 

* higher level of oxygen supplementation (odds ratio =  **4.58** , 95% CI = 1.58-13.23).

Conclusions: Infants with 25-OH vitamin D insufficiency had more severe viral respiratory illnesses. Breastfeeding was associated with insufficiency. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy might be a strategy to reduce risk and severity of respiratory illness in infants.
