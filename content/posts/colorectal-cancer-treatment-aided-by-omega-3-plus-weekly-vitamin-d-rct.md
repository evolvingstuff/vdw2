 **8 weeks of Omega-3 daily plus 50,000 IU vitamin D weekly** 

The good results would have been great if had

Used more Vitamin D (perhaps a loading dose)

Used a gut-friendly form of vitamin D

Participants take the Vitamin D with the largest meal of the day

Started the Vitamin D and Omega-3 before the surgery

Dose sizes which varied with weight (not one-size-fits-all)
