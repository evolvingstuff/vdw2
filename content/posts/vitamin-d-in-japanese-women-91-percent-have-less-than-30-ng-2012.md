Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular, hypertension, cancer, infectious and autoimmune diseases, as well as the risk of fractures. The major causes of vitamin D deficiency are lack of adequate vitamin D from dietary sources and avoidance of sensible sun exposure, amongst many others.

The control of Vitamin D is important for many women to continue working longer in good health.
