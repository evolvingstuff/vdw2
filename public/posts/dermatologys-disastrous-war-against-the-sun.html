However, while the relatively benign skin cancers are caused by sun exposure, the ones responsible for most skin cancer deaths are due to a lack of sunlight.</strong></p><p><strong>This is unfortunate because sunlight is arguably the most important nutrient for the human body, as avoiding it doubles one’s rate of dying and significantly increases their risk of cancer.</strong></p><p><strong>A strong case can be made that this dynamic was a result of the dermatology profession (with the help of a top PR firm) rebranding themselves to skin cancer fighters, something which allowed them to become one of the highest paying medical specialities in existence. Unfortunately, despite the billions that is put into fighting it each year, there has been no substantial change in the number of skin cancer deaths.</strong></p><ul><li>Note: US dermatologists who deal with skin cancer have <a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Do-ermatologists-dealing-6V75noJMRFe3HA.PHHLS8w>average salary of $260,000/year</a>, vs US GP $230,000/year</li></ul><p><strong>In this article, we will also discuss the dangers of the conventional skin cancer treatments, the most effective ways for treating and preventing skin cancer, and some of the best strategies for having a healthy and nourishing relationship with the sun.</strong></p><p>Note: in <a href=https://www.midwesterndoctor.com/p/the-year-in-review-and-my-gratitude>February’s open thread</a>, I presented some potential articles, and since this topic was one of the most requested, I have spent the last month working on it.</p><p>Ever since I was a little child something seemed off about the fact everyone would get hysterical about how I needed to avoid sunlight and always wear sunscreen whenever we had an outdoor activity—so to the best of my ability I just didn’t comply. As I got older, I started to notice that beyond the sun feeling really good, anytime I was in the sun, the veins under my skin that were exposed to the sun would dilate, which I took as a sign the body craved sunlight and wanted it to draw into the circulation. Later still, I learned a pioneering researcher found significant alternations would occur in the health of people who wore glasses that blocked specific light spectrums (e.g., most glass blocks UV light) from entering the most transparent part of the body that could be treated by giving them specialized glasses which did not block that spectrum from entering.</p><p>Note: all the above touches upon one of my favorite therapeutic modalities—ultraviolet blood irradiation, which will be the focus of an upcoming article.</p><p>Later, when I became a medical student (at which point I was familiar with the myriad of benefits of sunlight), I was struck by how neurotic dermatologists were about avoiding sunlight—for instance, in addition to hearing every patient I saw there be lectured about the importance of avoiding sunlight, through my classmates, I learned of dermatologists in the northern latitudes (which had low enough sunlight people suffered from seasonal affective disorder) effectively require their students to wear sunscreen and clothing which covered most of their body while indoors. At this point my perspective on the issue changed to “this crusade against the sun is definitely coming from the dermatologists” and “what on earth is wrong with these people?” A few years ago I learned the final piece of the puzzle through <a href=https://robertyoho.substack.com/>Robert Yoho MD</a> and his book <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Butchered-Healthcare-Robert-Yoho-MD/dp/1735485756>Butchered by Healthcare</a>.</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>cancer</span>
