&lt;p>Although traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often associated with gait deficits, the effects of TBI on spinal cord centers are poorly understood. We seek to determine the influence of TBI on the spinal cord and the potential of dietary omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids to counteract these effects. Male rodents exposed to diets containing adequate or deficient levels of n-3 since gestation received a moderate fluid percussion injury when becoming 14 weeks old. TBI reduced levels of molecular systems important for synaptic plasticity (BDNF, TrkB, and CREB) and plasma membrane homeostasis (4-HNE, iPLA2, syntaxin-3) in the lumbar spinal cord. These effects of TBI were more dramatic in the animals exposed to the n-3 deficient diet. Results emphasize the comprehensive action of TBI across the neuroaxis, and the critical role of dietary n-3 as a means to build resistance against the effects of TBI.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D repaired nerve in rat (50,000 IU daily dose equivalent for human)</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-repaired-nerve-in-rat-50000-iu-daily-dose-equivalent-for-human.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-repaired-nerve-in-rat-50000-iu-daily-dose-equivalent-for-human.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="cholecalciferol-vitamin-d3-improves-myelination-and-recovery-after-nerve-injury">Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) Improves Myelination and Recovery after Nerve Injury&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Previously, we demonstrated i) that ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) increases axon diameter and potentiates nerve regeneration in a rat model of transected peripheral nerve and ii) that cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) improves breathing and hyper-reflexia in a rat model of paraplegia. However, before bringing this molecule to the clinic, it was of prime importance i) to assess which form – ergocalciferol versus cholecalciferol – and which dose were the most efficient and ii) to identify the molecular pathways activated by this pleiotropic molecule.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spinal cord injuries may need more vitamin D than others</title><link>/posts/spinal-cord-injuries-may-need-more-vitamin-d-than-others.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jun 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/spinal-cord-injuries-may-need-more-vitamin-d-than-others.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">
