Aim: We aimed to examine whether there is any association between serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D3]</span> and urinary tract infection (UTI) among children. 

Methods: White blood cell count, serum C-reactive protein, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathormone, and serum 25(OH)D3 levels were measured in 82 children experiencing a ﬁrst episode of UTI, with no risk factors for UTI, and 64 healthy control children. 

Results: The mean serum levels of 25(OH)D3 among children with UTI were significantly lower than those of controls (11.7 ± 3.3 vs. 27.6 ± 4.7 ng/ml; p < 0.001). The serum levels of 25(OH)D3 were significantly lower in patients with acute pyelonephritis compared to patients with lower UTI (8.6 ± 2.8 vs. 14.2 ± 3.0 ng/ml; p < 0.001). Within the study group, mean serum levels of 25(OH)D3 among girls were lower than those of boys (10.9 ± 3.4 ng/ml vs. 13.2 ± 4.4 ng/ml; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that a serum 25(OH)D3 level of <20 ng/ml (odds ratio  **3.503** , 95% confidence interval 1.621-7.571; p = 0.001) was associated with UTI in children. 

Conclusions: Our results suggest that vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for UTI in children.
