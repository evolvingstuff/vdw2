*  **Antacids**  -- Taking certain antacids for long periods of time may alter the levels, metabolism, and availability of vitamin D.

*  **Calcium channel blockers**  (such as verapamil ) -- These medications, used to treat high blood pressure and heart conditions, may decrease the production of vitamin D by the body.

*  **Cholestyramine**  -- This cholesterol-lowering medication, known as a bile acid sequestrant, interferes with the absorption of vitamin D (as well as other fat-soluble vitamins).

*  **Phenobarbital, phenytoin (brand name Dilantin®), and other anticonvulsant medications**  -- These medications may accelerate the body's use of vitamin D.

*  **Mineral oil**  -- Mineral oil also interferes with absorption.

*  **Weight loss products**  -- Orlistat (also known as alli), a medication used for weight loss, and olestra, a substance added to certain food products, are both intended to bind to fat and prevent the absorption of fat and the associated calories.
