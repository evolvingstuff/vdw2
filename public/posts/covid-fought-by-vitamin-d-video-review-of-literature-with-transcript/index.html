<p>00:00:00</p>
<p>Hello everyone, this is Doctor Alex Vasquez with part 5 and my clinical review of vitamin D deficiency in adults, this time focusing on nutritional neglect versus antimicrobial defense. These are without any doubt whatsoever the four major pillars of what we call clinical ethics or medical ethics.</p>
<p>00:00:20</p>
<p>Now we could extend this list to include a few others. Sometimes the list goes to seven, but the four indisputable basic pillars of medical ethics are non malfeasance, beneficence, justice and autonomy, which includes informed consent.</p>
<p>00:00:37</p>
<p>So how does vitamin D play into this model? Well, we know that vitamin D strengthens barriers. It strengthens the epithelial cells, and it also increases antimicrobial peptide production in this case, including secretory IGA, which is the immunoglobulin on mucosal surfaces such as the gastrointestinal tract, genital urinary tract.</p>
<p>00:00:56</p>
<p>Oral cavity and respiratory tract, including the lungs. Furthermore, we know that vitamin D strengthens tight junctions between the cells and also improves the microbiome and that of course has effects throughout the entire body.</p>
<p>00:01:09</p>
<p>In various models, 125 dihydroxyvitamin D inhibits viral replication and we know that it also inhibits the transcription factor in F Kappa B which participates in viral replication as well.</p>
<p>00:01:23</p>
<p>As I showed you in video #4 vitamin D also inhibits or modulates and lowers tumor diagnosis factor alpha, which is an endogenous factor. It&rsquo;s a cytokine that actually stimulates viral replication, so if we can modulate that or lower that or control that with vitamin D, then of course that would indirectly inhibit viral replication and that would give the immune system.</p>
<p>00:01:44</p>
<p>Kind of the upper hand or a strategic advantage and what I&rsquo;ll show you right now is the new data showing that vitamin D functions as a mechanistic antiviral or a pharmacologic antiviral against the COVID-19 virus. Let&rsquo;s take a look at that right now from the American Journal of Physiology, 2021. This was published in June.</p>
<p>00:02:03</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s focus on the title showing that vitamin D metabolites can inhibit the SARS Co, V2 replication machinery enzymes. I&rsquo;ll read that to you one more time. Vitamin D metabolites can inhibit the SARS Co, V2 replication machinery. Enzymes. Let&rsquo;s focus in on their research.</p>
<p>00:02:22</p>
<p>Ratings metabolites of vitamin D and pre vitamin D produced in the skin following ultraviolet B exposure inhibited 2 key enzymes of the COVID-19 coronavirus, while 25 hydroxyvitamin D was impressively effective against both enzymes. Other UV B produced pre D3 metabolites were also potent.</p>
<p>00:02:44</p>
<p>And as I say here, in my own words, one could reasonably anticipate a synergistic or entourage effect.</p>
<p>00:02:50</p>
<p>Now let me show you 2 tables from this article here. In their table one they show binding affinities of various agents against the SARS Co V enzyme M Pro, as they&rsquo;ve stated here.</p>
<p>00:03:02</p>
<p>And again, this is specific to a replicative enzyme used by the SARS Co V2 virus called M Pro. Now let&rsquo;s look at the evidence against another enzyme here. So this is binding affinity of various drugs and metabolites against the COVID-19 enzyme Rd. RP. Again, in comparison with some standard antiviral drugs.</p>
<p>00:03:25</p>
<p>And lo and behold, we noticed that 25 hydroxyvitamin D, which is the dominant metabolite of vitamin D in the blood. We noticed that that particular metabolite is actually the most potent inhibitor or binder of the sensyu, again in SARS COVID 2 or the COVID-19 virus Rd. RP.</p>
<p>00:03:45</p>
<p>25 hydroxy vitamin D3 is something that we can increase in the serum very quickly through the use of nutritional supplementation and again it is the most potent metabolic.</p>
<p>00:03:54</p>
<p>Against this particular enzyme of the COVID-19 virus, more effective than other vitamin D metabolites and more effective than all of the antiviral drugs tested in this model.</p>
<p>00:04:07</p>
<p>So I invite you to take a look at that article if you have interest in it. Again, it was recently published American Journal of Physiology, 2021 in June, again published by the American Physiological Society. So let&rsquo;s continue my diagram explanation here again, supporting the biological plausibility of vitamin D use against viral infections.</p>
<p>00:04:28</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve already discussed the acquisition step or the direct antiviral step I talked about how vitamin D can directly and indirectly inhibit replication. Now let&rsquo;s talk about Immuno nutrition.</p>
<p>00:04:40</p>
<p>So we know that vitamin D improves antigen presentation cell mediated immunity immune globulin mediated immunity as well, and occasionally some studies have shown that vitamin D improves the response to vaccines, and that&rsquo;s what we would expect given what I&rsquo;ve said above, and that is it improves antigen presentation as well as antibody.</p>
<p>00:05:01</p>
<p>Mediated immunity.</p>
<p>00:05:04</p>
<p>And as I reviewed in great detail in video #4, we know that vitamin D modulates or reduces inflammation at the cellular and systemic level. We know that vitamin D supports mitochondrial function, reduces neuroinflammation, promotes inflammation. Resolution also promotes glutathione formation and magnesium absorption, and that would provide some collateral benefits.</p>
<p>00:05:25</p>
<p>And I also showed you in video #4A clinical study showing that vitamin D promotes recovery from virus infection and specifically the COVID-19 infection.</p>
<p>00:05:36</p>
<p>And finally, with regard to cellular and systemic health, I also showed you in video #1 how vitamin D alleviates chronic pain and pain amplification and in video #2 how vitamin D supplementation alleviates anxiety and depression. So I&rsquo;m going to focus today on viral infections, but a lot of this information would be essentially the same for bacterial and fungal infections.</p>
<p>00:05:59</p>
<p>So before we leave this page, I want everybody to focus in on what I had said before and that is that vitamin D functions at virtually every level.</p>
<p>00:06:08</p>
<p>Of non specific defense.</p>
<p>00:06:11</p>
<p>Viral inhibition and also immunity and systemic health.</p>
<p>00:06:17</p>
<p>So again, in defense against an invading microbe, whether that&rsquo;s a fungus or a bacteria or a virus, the entire body has to work in unison, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re going to see our best clinical results from agents that improve health, defense and resilience at every level.</p>
<p>00:06:36</p>
<p>Role starting with the acquisition of the microbe. In the case of viruses inhibiting viral replication, which occurs through human molecular machinery and then again in response to all microbes specific and nonspecific defenses, and the cellular and systemic consequences and response. So again, the ideal agent, and in this case we&rsquo;re talking about vitamin D.</p>
<p>00:06:59</p>
<p>Would function at every level, blocking acquisition blocking replication of viruses, supporting specific and non specific immune defenses and also supporting cellular and systemic health.</p>
<p>00:07:11</p>
<p>Now again, this explains the biological plausibility of using vitamin D against infectious diseases. Let&rsquo;s add one more level of detail on the following page.</p>
<p>00:07:22</p>
<p>Again, vitamin D functions at every level of barrier defense inhibiting viral replication also supporting innate and acquired immunity.</p>
<p>00:07:31</p>
<p>Vitamin D also supports cellular and systemic health to reduce the burden, severity, frequency and consequences of infectious diseases, and here I&rsquo;ll show you that vitamin D supplementation specifically increases production of interferon gamma, so interferon gamma is a cytokine and the reason it&rsquo;s called interferon is because it interferes.</p>
<p>00:07:52</p>
<p>With viral replication.</p>
<p>00:07:56</p>
<p>So again, if you&rsquo;re trying to explain this to yourself, to a patient or to a professional colleague or a professional adversary, one of the things you could say if they need something kind of focused, you could say, well vitamin D improves gamma interferon production and you know, of course that the interferons block viral replication. So let&rsquo;s look at that.</p>
<p>00:08:16</p>
<p>Year from the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, April 2020 Vitamin D administration increases production of interferon gamma measured in the serum here. So I&rsquo;ll show you this article more, but I wanted to kind of force.</p>
<p>00:08:29</p>
<p>Shadow it in this conversation again on biological plausibility and mechanisms. If someone needs a specific mechanism beyond what I&rsquo;ve already discussed, we can tell them that vitamin D supplementation increases production of interferon gamma and that interferon gamma has antiviral effects. So again, we&rsquo;ve got kind of the.</p>
<p>00:08:49</p>
<p>Biological plausibility here, and we have the clinical evidence here and I have much more where this came from. So let&rsquo;s look at a few more details specific to vitamin D and interferon, I showed you this study previously in video #4 we looked at this article from cytokine 2015.</p>
<p>00:09:05</p>
<p>Showing that supplemental vitamin D increased levels of interferon gamma and again, we know that interferon gamma is directly antiviral. So here&rsquo;s my definition of it. You can pause the video to take a read of that, but I want to show you a few highlights from a different article. This was published in Journal of Leukocyte Biology 2004, again the interferons.</p>
<p>00:09:27</p>
<p>Are cytokines that famously interfere with viral replication.</p>
<p>00:09:32</p>
<p>Interferon gamma also upregulates other aspects of the immune system for a more potent and efficient response to intracellular pathogens. And of course, all viruses are intracellular pathogens. Interferon gamma specifically supports the TH one or cell mediated type of immune response and again that&rsquo;s what we would expect against an intracellular.</p>
<p>00:09:53</p>
<p>And in video #3 I talked about antimicrobial peptides and other kind of non specific antimicrobial defenses, and we see that interferon gamma, which is supported by vitamin D supplementation, increases production of lysozyme, defensins and cathelicidins. Those are the classic antimicrobial peptides.</p>
<p>00:10:12</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, we want vitamin D levels to at least reach 40 nanograms per milliliter, or 100 nanomoles per liter.</p>
<p>00:10:22</p>
<p>This is what I published in 2004. More recently, I think we should aim for an optimal physiologic range of 50 to 90 nanograms per milliliter, also known as 125 to 225 nanomoles per liter. That is the normal physiologic range for sun exposed humans.</p>
<p>00:10:41</p>
<p>And to get people into that range, we should have started population wide, vitamin D supplementation.</p>
<p>00:10:47</p>
<p>At least 17 years ago, after I published this article in 2004 by failing to provide population wide vitamin D supplementation, we have invited pandemics of early death and infectious disease.</p>
<p>00:11:01</p>
<p>So even though COVID-19 is obviously a new type of infection, the data on the relationship between COVID-19 and vitamin D is absolutely stunning and consistent.</p>
<p>00:11:13</p>
<p>And very, very robust. And now we actually have clinical evidence showing the benefit of vitamin D supplementation against COVID-19 even when patients are already presenting with symptoms. And actually some of them are being hospitalized for those symptoms.</p>
<p>00:11:28</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll look at several different studies, but overall the data is very robust. Innumerable publications have demonstrated that low 25 hydroxy vitamin D is a risk factor for the incidence severity and mortality of COVID-19 infection. But medical organizations and governments have done.</p>
<p>00:11:44</p>
<p>While the entire world was saw on so-called lockdown and hundreds of millions of lives were disrupted, hundreds of thousands of deaths due to neglect and suicide and depression, we are far beyond scientific consensus on this topic, meaning that vitamin D is absolutely essential and effective against the initiation and.</p>
<p>00:12:04</p>
<p>Progression and fatal termination of COVID-19 infections. So what we&rsquo;re faced with here is political stagnation, not scientific stagnation. But of course, some of that research is politically.</p>
<p>00:12:17</p>
<p>Activated and I&rsquo;ll show you some examples of that. Let&rsquo;s look at this very important study published last year in Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in 2020. This was published in August out of southern Spain. This is a pilot study starting with 76 patients with COVID-19 in an area of Spain that typically has a vitamin D level.</p>
<p>00:12:37</p>
<p>Below 15 nanograms per milli.</p>
<p>00:12:41</p>
<p>And So what they did here was a little bit unusual in both dosing and the type of vitamin D that they used. They used 25 hydroxy vitamin D they did not use vitamin D3, they used the semi activated or activated form 25 hydroxy vitamin D and they administered it in somewhat of an unusual way. Their tablets or their capsules were 266 micrograms.</p>
<p>00:13:03</p>
<p>So patients receive two of those doses on the first day and then one on the third day, one on the 7th day and one on the 14th day.</p>
<p>00:13:12</p>
<p>And what they showed here was greater survival and less need for intensive care unit treatment.</p>
<p>00:13:17</p>
<p>So this is excellent initial data and from this point forward, if we&rsquo;re really going to take COVID-19 seriously as a pandemic infection, this one study was actually sufficient to initiate action from this point forward. The international medical and political so-called communities could have reasonably.</p>
<p>00:13:35</p>
<p>Started using vitamin.</p>
<p>00:13:36</p>
<p>Treatment, preventatively and therapeutically, rather than sit and do nothing, wait for a crisis telling these patients to go home until they&rsquo;re more sick and then come back for emergency care. That always results in higher mortality, so we could have taken action on this for more than a year. But the international medical and political so-called communities actively did nothing.</p>
<p>00:13:57</p>
<p>They actively suppress this information.</p>
<p>00:14:01</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another study published in the British Medical Journal&rsquo;s postgraduate Medical Journal, 2020 November. This is a population of 40 patients with mild COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency. They were treated with 60,000 international units per day to reach an optimal.</p>
<p>00:14:15</p>
<p>25 hydroxy.</p>
<p>00:14:16</p>
<p>Vitamin D level of at least 50 nanograms per milliliter, which is exactly the same as what I recommended.</p>
<p>00:14:23</p>
<p>About 10 years ago, in a publication for the American Chiropractic Association.</p>
<p>00:14:27</p>
<p>The beneficial effect included the fact that 62% of participants in the intervention group receiving vitamin D versus 20% in the control arm became COVID-19 negative within a period of two weeks. So that is showing you a direct antiviral effect of vitamin D against COVID-19. Again, that is showing you a direct.</p>
<p>00:14:48</p>
<p>And clinically important direct antiviral effect of vitamin D against COVID-19 fibrinogen levels were also decrease.</p>
<p>00:14:55</p>
<p>Released. So again, patients receiving vitamin D3 experienced triple the improvement in terms of becoming negative for COVID-19 and we all have to agree that that&rsquo;s one of the major goals is to make people virus negative so they don&rsquo;t have the virus and they&rsquo;re also not transmitting it.</p>
<p>00:15:14</p>
<p>So here again was another international game changer that was actively ignored and suppressed by medical groups and politicians, essentially all of whom are paid by Big Pharma. My opinion is that denying this line of research now confirmed multiple times by multiple international investigators is a crime against all humans who are affected by luck.</p>
<p>00:15:32</p>
<p>Towns, travel, work and leisure restrictions and loss of income and the right to live their lives normally.</p>
<p>00:15:39</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s look at another study using activated or semi activated vitamin D in the.</p>
<p>00:15:44</p>
<p>Form of 20.</p>
<p>00:15:44</p>
<p>5 hydroxyvitamin D This was conducted in 537 patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. So again this is another study out of Spain using 25 hydroxyvitamin D among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>00:15:59</p>
<p>And the effect of supplementation.</p>
<p>00:16:01</p>
<p>Was a 78%.</p>
<p>00:16:02</p>
<p>Reduction in death.</p>
<p>00:16:04</p>
<p>Again, if this were a drug, it would be considered a miracle and I think very positively of these researchers, I think of them as global patriots trying to save the world by showing the world that this pandemic viral infection can be easily managed by the use of competent vitamin D supplementation. It&rsquo;s safe. It&rsquo;s beneficial, it&rsquo;s available.</p>
<p>00:16:24</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s agreeable, and I think that if we were to just do it, we would change the course of this so-called global pandemic.</p>
<p>00:16:32</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at another study here. This is from Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism, 2021. This is another remarkable study published out of Spain involving 838 COVID-19 hospitalized patients at the hospital, Del Mar and Barcelona.</p>
<p>00:16:48</p>
<p>And the effect is an 87% reduction in intensive care unit admission and a 79% reduction in mortality.</p>
<p>00:16:58</p>
<p>These results are the most superior in terms of reduced ICU utilization, reduced mortality and cost effectiveness that have ever been documented for any therapy against COVID-19. To the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p>00:17:13</p>
<p>And here we are again. From this point forward, the international medical and political communities should have reasonably started using vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 rather than sit and do nothing, wait for the continuation of the crisis, and then use emergency care with high mortality. So if you want to look at these results graphically, they look.</p>
<p>00:17:32</p>
<p>Like this. This is the 15% mortality without vitamin D reduced to a 5% mortality with vitamin D.</p>
<p>00:17:40</p>
<p>Along with an 87% reduction in intensive care unit utilization, so that represents massive savings in healthcare utilization and expense, again with a 79% reduction in death. If this had been a drug study or a vaccine study, these researchers would have won the Nobel Prize, but because it was a vitamin D study, it was ignored.</p>
<p>00:18:02</p>
<p>So that brings us to a close today. Remember, we&rsquo;ve been talking about this now for 17 years, at least talking about the importance of giving patients the vitamin D that they need so we can avoid the disease predispositions that are predictable and which contribute to these global pandemics of various types of disease, not simply COVID-19.</p>
<p>00:18:22</p>
<p>So this was published.</p>
<p>00:18:23</p>
<p>Last year in nutrients in November of 2020, vitamin D insufficiency may account for almost 9 of 10 COVID-19 deaths time to act. Given the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and the proven safety of vitamin D segmentation, it therefore appears highly debatable and potentially even unethical.</p>
<p>00:18:42</p>
<p>To await results of such trials, even before public health action is taken. But we already have the clinical studies and I&rsquo;ve reviewed them with you here. So again, for acute dosing, we use 60,000 international units per day for 14 days or we use the semi activated form of 25 hydroxy vitamin D.</p>
<p>00:18:59</p>
<p>At roughly the equivalent of 5000 to 9000, international units per day, we know that this is safe, beneficial, available, agreeable and therefore clinically justified. So thank you very much for your attention. This has been part number 5 in my clinical review of vitamin D deficiency in adults, this time focusing on antimicrobial defense versus nutritional neglect.</p>
<p>00:19:21</p>
<p>Based on the mountain of research we have, showing the many benefits of vitamin D supplementation.</p>
<p>00:19:27</p>
<p>Thank you very much and again, this has been Doctor Alex Vasquez and I look forward to sharing more research with you soon.</p>

#### Transcript

00:00:00

Hello everyone, this is Doctor Alex Vasquez with part 5 and my clinical review of vitamin D deficiency in adults, this time focusing on nutritional neglect versus antimicrobial defense. These are without any doubt whatsoever the four major pillars of what we call clinical ethics or medical ethics.

00:00:20

Now we could extend this list to include a few others. Sometimes the list goes to seven, but the four indisputable basic pillars of medical ethics are non malfeasance, beneficence, justice and autonomy, which includes informed consent.

00:00:37

So how does vitamin D play into this model? Well, we know that vitamin D strengthens barriers. It strengthens the epithelial cells, and it also increases antimicrobial peptide production in this case, including secretory IGA, which is the immunoglobulin on mucosal surfaces such as the gastrointestinal tract, genital urinary tract.

00:00:56

Oral cavity and respiratory tract, including the lungs. Furthermore, we know that vitamin D strengthens tight junctions between the cells and also improves the microbiome and that of course has effects throughout the entire body.

00:01:09

In various models, 125 dihydroxyvitamin D inhibits viral replication and we know that it also inhibits the transcription factor in F Kappa B which participates in viral replication as well.

00:01:23

As I showed you in video #4 vitamin D also inhibits or modulates and lowers tumor diagnosis factor alpha, which is an endogenous factor. It&#39;s a cytokine that actually stimulates viral replication, so if we can modulate that or lower that or control that with vitamin D, then of course that would indirectly inhibit viral replication and that would give the immune system.

00:01:44

Kind of the upper hand or a strategic advantage and what I&#39;ll show you right now is the new data showing that vitamin D functions as a mechanistic antiviral or a pharmacologic antiviral against the COVID-19 virus. Let&#39;s take a look at that right now from the American Journal of Physiology, 2021. This was published in June.

00:02:03

And let&#39;s focus on the title showing that vitamin D metabolites can inhibit the SARS Co, V2 replication machinery enzymes. I&#39;ll read that to you one more time. Vitamin D metabolites can inhibit the SARS Co, V2 replication machinery. Enzymes. Let&#39;s focus in on their research.

00:02:22

Ratings metabolites of vitamin D and pre vitamin D produced in the skin following ultraviolet B exposure inhibited 2 key enzymes of the COVID-19 coronavirus, while 25 hydroxyvitamin D was impressively effective against both enzymes. Other UV B produced pre D3 metabolites were also potent.

00:02:44

And as I say here, in my own words, one could reasonably anticipate a synergistic or entourage effect.

00:02:50

Now let me show you 2 tables from this article here. In their table one they show binding affinities of various agents against the SARS Co V enzyme M Pro, as they&#39;ve stated here.

00:03:02

And again, this is specific to a replicative enzyme used by the SARS Co V2 virus called M Pro. Now let&#39;s look at the evidence against another enzyme here. So this is binding affinity of various drugs and metabolites against the COVID-19 enzyme Rd. RP. Again, in comparison with some standard antiviral drugs.

00:03:25

And lo and behold, we noticed that 25 hydroxyvitamin D, which is the dominant metabolite of vitamin D in the blood. We noticed that that particular metabolite is actually the most potent inhibitor or binder of the sensyu, again in SARS COVID 2 or the COVID-19 virus Rd. RP.

00:03:45

25 hydroxy vitamin D3 is something that we can increase in the serum very quickly through the use of nutritional supplementation and again it is the most potent metabolic.

00:03:54

Against this particular enzyme of the COVID-19 virus, more effective than other vitamin D metabolites and more effective than all of the antiviral drugs tested in this model.

00:04:07

So I invite you to take a look at that article if you have interest in it. Again, it was recently published American Journal of Physiology, 2021 in June, again published by the American Physiological Society. So let&#39;s continue my diagram explanation here again, supporting the biological plausibility of vitamin D use against viral infections.

00:04:28

So I&#39;ve already discussed the acquisition step or the direct antiviral step I talked about how vitamin D can directly and indirectly inhibit replication. Now let&#39;s talk about Immuno nutrition.

00:04:40

So we know that vitamin D improves antigen presentation cell mediated immunity immune globulin mediated immunity as well, and occasionally some studies have shown that vitamin D improves the response to vaccines, and that&#39;s what we would expect given what I&#39;ve said above, and that is it improves antigen presentation as well as antibody.

00:05:01

Mediated immunity.

00:05:04

And as I reviewed in great detail in video #4, we know that vitamin D modulates or reduces inflammation at the cellular and systemic level. We know that vitamin D supports mitochondrial function, reduces neuroinflammation, promotes inflammation. Resolution also promotes glutathione formation and magnesium absorption, and that would provide some collateral benefits.

00:05:25

And I also showed you in video #4A clinical study showing that vitamin D promotes recovery from virus infection and specifically the COVID-19 infection.

00:05:36

And finally, with regard to cellular and systemic health, I also showed you in video #1 how vitamin D alleviates chronic pain and pain amplification and in video #2 how vitamin D supplementation alleviates anxiety and depression. So I&#39;m going to focus today on viral infections, but a lot of this information would be essentially the same for bacterial and fungal infections.

00:05:59

So before we leave this page, I want everybody to focus in on what I had said before and that is that vitamin D functions at virtually every level.

00:06:08

Of non specific defense.

00:06:11

Viral inhibition and also immunity and systemic health.

00:06:17

So again, in defense against an invading microbe, whether that&#39;s a fungus or a bacteria or a virus, the entire body has to work in unison, and that&#39;s why we&#39;re going to see our best clinical results from agents that improve health, defense and resilience at every level.

00:06:36

Role starting with the acquisition of the microbe. In the case of viruses inhibiting viral replication, which occurs through human molecular machinery and then again in response to all microbes specific and nonspecific defenses, and the cellular and systemic consequences and response. So again, the ideal agent, and in this case we&#39;re talking about vitamin D.

00:06:59

Would function at every level, blocking acquisition blocking replication of viruses, supporting specific and non specific immune defenses and also supporting cellular and systemic health.

00:07:11

Now again, this explains the biological plausibility of using vitamin D against infectious diseases. Let&#39;s add one more level of detail on the following page.

00:07:22

Again, vitamin D functions at every level of barrier defense inhibiting viral replication also supporting innate and acquired immunity.

00:07:31

Vitamin D also supports cellular and systemic health to reduce the burden, severity, frequency and consequences of infectious diseases, and here I&#39;ll show you that vitamin D supplementation specifically increases production of interferon gamma, so interferon gamma is a cytokine and the reason it&#39;s called interferon is because it interferes.

00:07:52

With viral replication.

00:07:56

So again, if you&#39;re trying to explain this to yourself, to a patient or to a professional colleague or a professional adversary, one of the things you could say if they need something kind of focused, you could say, well vitamin D improves gamma interferon production and you know, of course that the interferons block viral replication. So let&#39;s look at that.

00:08:16

Year from the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, April 2020 Vitamin D administration increases production of interferon gamma measured in the serum here. So I&#39;ll show you this article more, but I wanted to kind of force.

00:08:29

Shadow it in this conversation again on biological plausibility and mechanisms. If someone needs a specific mechanism beyond what I&#39;ve already discussed, we can tell them that vitamin D supplementation increases production of interferon gamma and that interferon gamma has antiviral effects. So again, we&#39;ve got kind of the.

00:08:49

Biological plausibility here, and we have the clinical evidence here and I have much more where this came from. So let&#39;s look at a few more details specific to vitamin D and interferon, I showed you this study previously in video #4 we looked at this article from cytokine 2015.

00:09:05

Showing that supplemental vitamin D increased levels of interferon gamma and again, we know that interferon gamma is directly antiviral. So here&#39;s my definition of it. You can pause the video to take a read of that, but I want to show you a few highlights from a different article. This was published in Journal of Leukocyte Biology 2004, again the interferons.

00:09:27

Are cytokines that famously interfere with viral replication.

00:09:32

Interferon gamma also upregulates other aspects of the immune system for a more potent and efficient response to intracellular pathogens. And of course, all viruses are intracellular pathogens. Interferon gamma specifically supports the TH one or cell mediated type of immune response and again that&#39;s what we would expect against an intracellular.

00:09:53

And in video #3 I talked about antimicrobial peptides and other kind of non specific antimicrobial defenses, and we see that interferon gamma, which is supported by vitamin D supplementation, increases production of lysozyme, defensins and cathelicidins. Those are the classic antimicrobial peptides.

00:10:12

As I&#39;ve said before, we want vitamin D levels to at least reach 40 nanograms per milliliter, or 100 nanomoles per liter.

00:10:22

This is what I published in 2004. More recently, I think we should aim for an optimal physiologic range of 50 to 90 nanograms per milliliter, also known as 125 to 225 nanomoles per liter. That is the normal physiologic range for sun exposed humans.

00:10:41

And to get people into that range, we should have started population wide, vitamin D supplementation.

00:10:47

At least 17 years ago, after I published this article in 2004 by failing to provide population wide vitamin D supplementation, we have invited pandemics of early death and infectious disease.

00:11:01

So even though COVID-19 is obviously a new type of infection, the data on the relationship between COVID-19 and vitamin D is absolutely stunning and consistent.

00:11:13

And very, very robust. And now we actually have clinical evidence showing the benefit of vitamin D supplementation against COVID-19 even when patients are already presenting with symptoms. And actually some of them are being hospitalized for those symptoms.

00:11:28

So we&#39;ll look at several different studies, but overall the data is very robust. Innumerable publications have demonstrated that low 25 hydroxy vitamin D is a risk factor for the incidence severity and mortality of COVID-19 infection. But medical organizations and governments have done.

00:11:44

While the entire world was saw on so-called lockdown and hundreds of millions of lives were disrupted, hundreds of thousands of deaths due to neglect and suicide and depression, we are far beyond scientific consensus on this topic, meaning that vitamin D is absolutely essential and effective against the initiation and.

00:12:04

Progression and fatal termination of COVID-19 infections. So what we&#39;re faced with here is political stagnation, not scientific stagnation. But of course, some of that research is politically.

00:12:17

Activated and I&#39;ll show you some examples of that. Let&#39;s look at this very important study published last year in Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in 2020. This was published in August out of southern Spain. This is a pilot study starting with 76 patients with COVID-19 in an area of Spain that typically has a vitamin D level.

00:12:37

Below 15 nanograms per milli.

00:12:41

And So what they did here was a little bit unusual in both dosing and the type of vitamin D that they used. They used 25 hydroxy vitamin D they did not use vitamin D3, they used the semi activated or activated form 25 hydroxy vitamin D and they administered it in somewhat of an unusual way. Their tablets or their capsules were 266 micrograms.

00:13:03

So patients receive two of those doses on the first day and then one on the third day, one on the 7th day and one on the 14th day.

00:13:12

And what they showed here was greater survival and less need for intensive care unit treatment.

00:13:17

So this is excellent initial data and from this point forward, if we&#39;re really going to take COVID-19 seriously as a pandemic infection, this one study was actually sufficient to initiate action from this point forward. The international medical and political so-called communities could have reasonably.

00:13:35

Started using vitamin.

00:13:36

Treatment, preventatively and therapeutically, rather than sit and do nothing, wait for a crisis telling these patients to go home until they&#39;re more sick and then come back for emergency care. That always results in higher mortality, so we could have taken action on this for more than a year. But the international medical and political so-called communities actively did nothing.

00:13:57

They actively suppress this information.

00:14:01

Here&#39;s another study published in the British Medical Journal&#39;s postgraduate Medical Journal, 2020 November. This is a population of 40 patients with mild COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency. They were treated with 60,000 international units per day to reach an optimal.

00:14:15

25 hydroxy.

00:14:16

Vitamin D level of at least 50 nanograms per milliliter, which is exactly the same as what I recommended.

00:14:23

About 10 years ago, in a publication for the American Chiropractic Association.

00:14:27

The beneficial effect included the fact that 62% of participants in the intervention group receiving vitamin D versus 20% in the control arm became COVID-19 negative within a period of two weeks. So that is showing you a direct antiviral effect of vitamin D against COVID-19. Again, that is showing you a direct.

00:14:48

And clinically important direct antiviral effect of vitamin D against COVID-19 fibrinogen levels were also decrease.

00:14:55

Released. So again, patients receiving vitamin D3 experienced triple the improvement in terms of becoming negative for COVID-19 and we all have to agree that that&#39;s one of the major goals is to make people virus negative so they don&#39;t have the virus and they&#39;re also not transmitting it.

00:15:14

So here again was another international game changer that was actively ignored and suppressed by medical groups and politicians, essentially all of whom are paid by Big Pharma. My opinion is that denying this line of research now confirmed multiple times by multiple international investigators is a crime against all humans who are affected by luck.

00:15:32

Towns, travel, work and leisure restrictions and loss of income and the right to live their lives normally.

00:15:39

So now let&#39;s look at another study using activated or semi activated vitamin D in the.

00:15:44

Form of 20.

00:15:44

5 hydroxyvitamin D This was conducted in 537 patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. So again this is another study out of Spain using 25 hydroxyvitamin D among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

00:15:59

And the effect of supplementation.

00:16:01

Was a 78%.

00:16:02

Reduction in death.

00:16:04

Again, if this were a drug, it would be considered a miracle and I think very positively of these researchers, I think of them as global patriots trying to save the world by showing the world that this pandemic viral infection can be easily managed by the use of competent vitamin D supplementation. It&#39;s safe. It&#39;s beneficial, it&#39;s available.

00:16:24

It&#39;s agreeable, and I think that if we were to just do it, we would change the course of this so-called global pandemic.

00:16:32

Let&#39;s look at another study here. This is from Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism, 2021. This is another remarkable study published out of Spain involving 838 COVID-19 hospitalized patients at the hospital, Del Mar and Barcelona.

00:16:48

And the effect is an 87% reduction in intensive care unit admission and a 79% reduction in mortality.

00:16:58

These results are the most superior in terms of reduced ICU utilization, reduced mortality and cost effectiveness that have ever been documented for any therapy against COVID-19. To the best of my knowledge.

00:17:13

And here we are again. From this point forward, the international medical and political communities should have reasonably started using vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 rather than sit and do nothing, wait for the continuation of the crisis, and then use emergency care with high mortality. So if you want to look at these results graphically, they look.

00:17:32

Like this. This is the 15% mortality without vitamin D reduced to a 5% mortality with vitamin D.

00:17:40

Along with an 87% reduction in intensive care unit utilization, so that represents massive savings in healthcare utilization and expense, again with a 79% reduction in death. If this had been a drug study or a vaccine study, these researchers would have won the Nobel Prize, but because it was a vitamin D study, it was ignored.

00:18:02

So that brings us to a close today. Remember, we&#39;ve been talking about this now for 17 years, at least talking about the importance of giving patients the vitamin D that they need so we can avoid the disease predispositions that are predictable and which contribute to these global pandemics of various types of disease, not simply COVID-19.

00:18:22

So this was published.

00:18:23

Last year in nutrients in November of 2020, vitamin D insufficiency may account for almost 9 of 10 COVID-19 deaths time to act. Given the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and the proven safety of vitamin D segmentation, it therefore appears highly debatable and potentially even unethical.

00:18:42

To await results of such trials, even before public health action is taken. But we already have the clinical studies and I&#39;ve reviewed them with you here. So again, for acute dosing, we use 60,000 international units per day for 14 days or we use the semi activated form of 25 hydroxy vitamin D.

00:18:59

At roughly the equivalent of 5000 to 9000, international units per day, we know that this is safe, beneficial, available, agreeable and therefore clinically justified. So thank you very much for your attention. This has been part number 5 in my clinical review of vitamin D deficiency in adults, this time focusing on antimicrobial defense versus nutritional neglect.

00:19:21

Based on the mountain of research we have, showing the many benefits of vitamin D supplementation.

00:19:27

Thank you very much and again, this has been Doctor Alex Vasquez and I look forward to sharing more research with you soon.

00:19:33

│   full_match: `\n00:00:00\nHello everyone, this is Doctor Alex Vasquez with part 5 and my clinical review of vitamin D deficiency in adults, this time focusing on nutritional neglect versus antimicrobial defense. These are without any doubt whatsoever the four major pillars of what we call clinical ethics or medical ethics.\n00:00:20\nNow we could extend this list to include a few others. Sometimes the list goes to seven, but the four indisputable basic pillars of medical ethics are non malfeasance, beneficence, justice and autonomy, which includes informed consent.\n00:00:37\nSo how does vitamin D play into this model? Well, we know that vitamin D strengthens barriers. It strengthens the epithelial cells, and it also increases antimicrobial peptide production in this case, including secretory IGA, which is the immunoglobulin on mucosal surfaces such as the gastrointestinal tract, genital urinary tract.\n00:00:56\nOral cavity and respiratory tract, including the lungs. Furthermore, we know that vitamin D strengthens tight junctions between the cells and also improves the microbiome and that of course has effects throughout the entire body.\n00:01:09\nIn various models, 125 dihydroxyvitamin D inhibits viral replication and we know that it also inhibits the transcription factor in F Kappa B which participates in viral replication as well.\n00:01:23\nAs I showed you in video #4 vitamin D also inhibits or modulates and lowers tumor diagnosis factor alpha, which is an endogenous factor. It&#39;s a cytokine that actually stimulates viral replication, so if we can modulate that or lower that or control that with vitamin D, then of course that would indirectly inhibit viral replication and that would give the immune system.\n00:01:44\nKind of the upper hand or a strategic advantage and what I&#39;ll show you right now is the new data showing that vitamin D functions as a mechanistic antiviral or a pharmacologic antiviral against the COVID-19 virus. Let&#39;s take a look at that right now from the American Journal of Physiology, 2021. This was published in June.\n00:02:03\nAnd let&#39;s focus on the title showing that vitamin D metabolites can inhibit the SARS Co, V2 replication machinery enzymes. I&#39;ll read that to you one more time. Vitamin D metabolites can inhibit the SARS Co, V2 replication machinery. Enzymes. Let&#39;s focus in on their research.\n00:02:22\nRatings metabolites of vitamin D and pre vitamin D produced in the skin following ultraviolet B exposure inhibited 2 key enzymes of the COVID-19 coronavirus, while 25 hydroxyvitamin D was impressively effective against both enzymes. Other UV B produced pre D3 metabolites were also potent.\n00:02:44\nAnd as I say here, in my own words, one could reasonably anticipate a synergistic or entourage effect.\n00:02:50\nNow let me show you 2 tables from this article here. In their table one they show binding affinities of various agents against the SARS Co V enzyme M Pro, as they&#39;ve stated here.\n00:03:02\nAnd again, this is specific to a replicative enzyme used by the SARS Co V2 virus called M Pro. Now let&#39;s look at the evidence against another enzyme here. So this is binding affinity of various drugs and metabolites against the COVID-19 enzyme Rd. RP. Again, in comparison with some standard antiviral drugs.\n00:03:25\nAnd lo and behold, we noticed that 25 hydroxyvitamin D, which is the dominant metabolite of vitamin D in the blood. We noticed that that particular metabolite is actually the most potent inhibitor or binder of the sensyu, again in SARS COVID 2 or the COVID-19 virus Rd. RP.\n00:03:45\n25 hydroxy vitamin D3 is something that we can increase in the serum very quickly through the use of nutritional supplementation and again it is the most potent metabolic.\n00:03:54\nAgainst this particular enzyme of the COVID-19 virus, more effective than other vitamin D metabolites and more effective than all of the antiviral drugs tested in this model.\n00:04:07\nSo I invite you to take a look at that article if you have interest in it. Again, it was recently published American Journal of Physiology, 2021 in June, again published by the American Physiological Society. So let&#39;s continue my diagram explanation here again, supporting the biological plausibility of vitamin D use against viral infections.\n00:04:28\nSo I&#39;ve already discussed the acquisition step or the direct antiviral step I talked about how vitamin D can directly and indirectly inhibit replication. Now let&#39;s talk about Immuno nutrition.\n00:04:40\nSo we know that vitamin D improves antigen presentation cell mediated immunity immune globulin mediated immunity as well, and occasionally some studies have shown that vitamin D improves the response to vaccines, and that&#39;s what we would expect given what I&#39;ve said above, and that is it improves antigen presentation as well as antibody.\n00:05:01\nMediated immunity.\n00:05:04\nAnd as I reviewed in great detail in video #4, we know that vitamin D modulates or reduces inflammation at the cellular and systemic level. We know that vitamin D supports mitochondrial function, reduces neuroinflammation, promotes inflammation. Resolution also promotes glutathione formation and magnesium absorption, and that would provide some collateral benefits.\n00:05:25\nAnd I also showed you in video #4A clinical study showing that vitamin D promotes recovery from virus infection and specifically the COVID-19 infection.\n00:05:36\nAnd finally, with regard to cellular and systemic health, I also showed you in video #1 how vitamin D alleviates chronic pain and pain amplification and in video #2 how vitamin D supplementation alleviates anxiety and depression. So I&#39;m going to focus today on viral infections, but a lot of this information would be essentially the same for bacterial and fungal infections.\n00:05:59\nSo before we leave this page, I want everybody to focus in on what I had said before and that is that vitamin D functions at virtually every level.\n00:06:08\nOf non specific defense.\n00:06:11\nViral inhibition and also immunity and systemic health.\n00:06:17\nSo again, in defense against an invading microbe, whether that&#39;s a fungus or a bacteria or a virus, the entire body has to work in unison, and that&#39;s why we&#39;re going to see our best clinical results from agents that improve health, defense and resilience at every level.\n00:06:36\nRole starting with the acquisition of the microbe.

That is the normal physiologic range for sun exposed humans.\n00:10:41\nAnd to get people into that range, we should have started population wide, vitamin D supplementation.\n00:10:47\nAt least 17 years ago, after I published this article in 2004 by failing to provide population wide vitamin D supplementation, we have invited pandemics of early death and infectious disease.\n00:11:01\nSo even though COVID-19 is obviously a new type of infection, the data on the relationship between COVID-19 and vitamin D is absolutely stunning and consistent.\n00:11:13\nAnd very, very robust. And now we actually have clinical evidence showing the benefit of vitamin D supplementation against COVID-19 even when patients are already presenting with symptoms. And actually some of them are being hospitalized for those symptoms.\n00:11:28\nSo we&#39;ll look at several different studies, but overall the data is very robust. Innumerable publications have demonstrated that low 25 hydroxy vitamin D is a risk factor for the incidence severity and mortality of COVID-19 infection. But medical organizations and governments have done.\n00:11:44\nWhile the entire world was saw on so-called lockdown and hundreds of millions of lives were disrupted, hundreds of thousands of deaths due to neglect and suicide and depression, we are far beyond scientific consensus on this topic, meaning that vitamin D is absolutely essential and effective against the initiation and.\n00:12:04\nProgression and fatal termination of COVID-19 infections. So what we&#39;re faced with here is political stagnation, not scientific stagnation. But of course, some of that research is politically.\n00:12:17\nActivated and I&#39;ll show you some examples of that. Let&#39;s look at this very important study published last year in Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in 2020. This was published in August out of southern Spain. This is a pilot study starting with 76 patients with COVID-19 in an area of Spain that typically has a vitamin D level.\n00:12:37\nBelow 15 nanograms per milli.\n00:12:41\nAnd So what they did here was a little bit unusual in both dosing and the type of vitamin D that they used. They used 25 hydroxy vitamin D they did not use vitamin D3, they used the semi activated or activated form 25 hydroxy vitamin D and they administered it in somewhat of an unusual way. Their tablets or their capsules were 266 micrograms.\n00:13:03\nSo patients receive two of those doses on the first day and then one on the third day, one on the 7th day and one on the 14th day.\n00:13:12\nAnd what they showed here was greater survival and less need for intensive care unit treatment.\n00:13:17\nSo this is excellent initial data and from this point forward, if we&#39;re really going to take COVID-19 seriously as a pandemic infection, this one study was actually sufficient to initiate action from this point forward. The international medical and political so-called communities could have reasonably.\n00:13:35\nStarted using vitamin.\n00:13:36\nTreatment, preventatively and therapeutically, rather than sit and do nothing, wait for a crisis telling these patients to go home until they&#39;re more sick and then come back for emergency care. That always results in higher mortality, so we could have taken action on this for more than a year. But the international medical and political so-called communities actively did nothing.\n00:13:57\nThey actively suppress this information.\n00:14:01\nHere&#39;s another study published in the British Medical Journal&#39;s postgraduate Medical Journal, 2020 November. This is a population of 40 patients with mild COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency. They were treated with 60,000 international units per day to reach an optimal.\n00:14:15\n25 hydroxy.\n00:14:16\nVitamin D level of at least 50 nanograms per milliliter, which is exactly the same as what I recommended.\n00:14:23\nAbout 10 years ago, in a publication for the American Chiropractic Association.\n00:14:27\nThe beneficial effect included the fact that 62% of participants in the intervention group receiving vitamin D versus 20% in the control arm became COVID-19 negative within a period of two weeks. So that is showing you a direct antiviral effect of vitamin D against COVID-19. Again, that is showing you a direct.\n00:14:48\nAnd clinically important direct antiviral effect of vitamin D against COVID-19 fibrinogen levels were also decrease.\n00:14:55\nReleased. So again, patients receiving vitamin D3 experienced triple the improvement in terms of becoming negative for COVID-19 and we all have to agree that that&#39;s one of the major goals is to make people virus negative so they don&#39;t have the virus and they&#39;re also not transmitting it.\n00:15:14\nSo here again was another international game changer that was actively ignored and suppressed by medical groups and politicians, essentially all of whom are paid by Big Pharma. My opinion is that denying this line of research now confirmed multiple times by multiple international investigators is a crime against all humans who are affected by luck.\n00:15:32\nTowns, travel, work and leisure restrictions and loss of income and the right to live their lives normally.\n00:15:39\nSo now let&#39;s look at another study using activated or semi activated vitamin D in the.\n00:15:44\nForm of 20.\n00:15:44\n5 hydroxyvitamin D This was conducted in 537 patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. So again this is another study out of Spain using 25 hydroxyvitamin D among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n00:15:59\nAnd the effect of supplementation.\n00:16:01\nWas a 78%.\n00:16:02\nReduction in death.\n00:16:04\nAgain, if this were a drug, it would be considered a miracle and I think very positively of these researchers, I think of them as global patriots trying to save the world by showing the world that this pandemic viral infection can be easily managed by the use of competent vitamin D supplementation. It&#39;s safe. It&#39;s beneficial, it&#39;s available.\n00:16:24\nIt&#39;s agreeable, and I think that if we were to just do it, we would change the course of this so-called global pandemic.\n00:16:32\nLet&#39;s look at another study here. This is from Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism, 2021. This is another remarkable study published out of Spain involving 838 COVID-19 hospitalized patients at the hospital, Del Mar and Barcelona.\n00:16:48\nAnd the effect is an 87% reduction in intensive care unit admission and a 79% reduction in mortality.\n00:16:58\nThese results are the most superior in terms of reduced ICU utilization, reduced mortality and cost effectiveness that have ever been documented for any therapy against COVID-19. To the best of my knowledge.\n00:17:13\nAnd here we are again. From this point forward, the international medical and political communities should have reasonably started using vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 rather than sit and do nothing, wait for the continuation of the crisis, and then use emergency care with high mortality. So if you want to look at these results graphically, they look.\n00:17:32\nLike this. This is the 15% mortality without vitamin D reduced to a 5% mortality with vitamin D.\n00:17:40\nAlong with an 87% reduction in intensive care unit utilization, so that represents massive savings in healthcare utilization and expense, again with a 79% reduction in death. If this had been a drug study or a vaccine study, these researchers would have won the Nobel Prize, but because it was a vitamin D study, it was ignored.\n00:18:02\nSo that brings us to a close today. Remember, we&#39;ve been talking about this now for 17 years, at least talking about the importance of giving patients the vitamin D that they need so we can avoid the disease predispositions that are predictable and which contribute to these global pandemics of various types of disease, not simply COVID-19.\n00:18:22\nSo this was published.\n00:18:23\nLast year in nutrients in November of 2020, vitamin D insufficiency may account for almost 9 of 10 COVID-19 deaths time to act. Given the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and the proven safety of vitamin D segmentation, it therefore appears highly debatable and potentially even unethical.\n00:18:42\nTo await results of such trials, even before public health action is taken. But we already have the clinical studies and I&#39;ve reviewed them with you here. So again, for acute dosing, we use 60,000 international units per day for 14 days or we use the semi activated form of 25 hydroxy vitamin D.\n00:18:59\nAt roughly the equivalent of 5000 to 9000, international units per day, we know that this is safe, beneficial, available, agreeable and therefore clinically justified. So thank you very much for your attention. This has been part number 5 in my clinical review of vitamin D deficiency in adults, this time focusing on antimicrobial defense versus nutritional neglect.\n00:19:21\nBased on the mountain of research we have, showing the many benefits of vitamin D supplementation.\n00:19:27\nThank you very much and again, this has been Doctor Alex Vasquez and I look forward to sharing more research with you soon.\n00:19:33\nMeanwhile, please take a look at my blog at healthythinking.substacks.com. You can also find my books and all major booksellers worldwide, and you can also see more information on my other main website, whichisinflammationmastery.com. Thank you again.`
│   inner_content: `\n00:00:00\nHello everyone, this is Doctor Alex Vasquez with part 5 and my clinical review of vitamin D deficiency in adults, this time focusing on nutritional neglect versus antimicrobial defense. These are without any doubt whatsoever the four major pillars of what we call clinical ethics or medical ethics.\n00:00:20\nNow we could extend this list to include a few others. Sometimes the list goes to seven, but the four indisputable basic pillars of medical ethics are non malfeasance, beneficence, justice and autonomy, which includes informed consent.\n00:00:37\nSo how does vitamin D play into this model? Well, we know that vitamin D strengthens barriers. It strengthens the epithelial cells, and it also increases antimicrobial peptide production in this case, including secretory IGA, which is the immunoglobulin on mucosal surfaces such as the gastrointestinal tract, genital urinary tract.\n00:00:56\nOral cavity and respiratory tract, including the lungs. Furthermore, we know that vitamin D strengthens tight junctions between the cells and also improves the microbiome and that of course has effects throughout the entire body.\n00:01:09\nIn various models, 125 dihydroxyvitamin D inhibits viral replication and we know that it also inhibits the transcription factor in F Kappa B which participates in viral replication as well.\n00:01:23\nAs I showed you in video #4 vitamin D also inhibits or modulates and lowers tumor diagnosis factor alpha, which is an endogenous factor. It&#39;s a cytokine that actually stimulates viral replication, so if we can modulate that or lower that or control that with vitamin D, then of course that would indirectly inhibit viral replication and that would give the immune system.\n00:01:44\nKind of the upper hand or a strategic advantage and what I&#39;ll show you right now is the new data showing that vitamin D functions as a mechanistic antiviral or a pharmacologic antiviral against the COVID-19 virus. Let&#39;s take a look at that right now from the American Journal of Physiology, 2021. This was published in June.\n00:02:03\nAnd let&#39;s focus on the title showing that vitamin D metabolites can inhibit the SARS Co, V2 replication machinery enzymes. I&#39;ll read that to you one more time. Vitamin D metabolites can inhibit the SARS Co, V2 replication machinery. Enzymes. Let&#39;s focus in on their research.\n00:02:22\nRatings metabolites of vitamin D and pre vitamin D produced in the skin following ultraviolet B exposure inhibited 2 key enzymes of the COVID-19 coronavirus, while 25 hydroxyvitamin D was impressively effective against both enzymes. Other UV B produced pre D3 metabolites were also potent.\n00:02:44\nAnd as I say here, in my own words, one could reasonably anticipate a synergistic or entourage effect.\n00:02:50\nNow let me show you 2 tables from this article here. In their table one they show binding affinities of various agents against the SARS Co V enzyme M Pro, as they&#39;ve stated here.\n00:03:02\nAnd again, this is specific to a replicative enzyme used by the SARS Co V2 virus called M Pro. Now let&#39;s look at the evidence against another enzyme here. So this is binding affinity of various drugs and metabolites against the COVID-19 enzyme Rd. RP. Again, in comparison with some standard antiviral drugs.\n00:03:25\nAnd lo and behold, we noticed that 25 hydroxyvitamin D, which is the dominant metabolite of vitamin D in the blood. We noticed that that particular metabolite is actually the most potent inhibitor or binder of the sensyu, again in SARS COVID 2 or the COVID-19 virus Rd. RP.\n00:03:45\n25 hydroxy vitamin D3 is something that we can increase in the serum very quickly through the use of nutritional supplementation and again it is the most potent metabolic.\n00:03:54\nAgainst this particular enzyme of the COVID-19 virus, more effective than other vitamin D metabolites and more effective than all of the antiviral drugs tested in this model.\n00:04:07\nSo I invite you to take a look at that article if you have interest in it. Again, it was recently published American Journal of Physiology, 2021 in June, again published by the American Physiological Society. So let&#39;s continue my diagram explanation here again, supporting the biological plausibility of vitamin D use against viral infections.\n00:04:28\nSo I&#39;ve already discussed the acquisition step or the direct antiviral step I talked about how vitamin D can directly and indirectly inhibit replication. Now let&#39;s talk about Immuno nutrition.\n00:04:40\nSo we know that vitamin D improves antigen presentation cell mediated immunity immune globulin mediated immunity as well, and occasionally some studies have shown that vitamin D improves the response to vaccines, and that&#39;s what we would expect given what I&#39;ve said above, and that is it improves antigen presentation as well as antibody.\n00:05:01\nMediated immunity.\n00:05:04\nAnd as I reviewed in great detail in video #4, we know that vitamin D modulates or reduces inflammation at the cellular and systemic level. We know that vitamin D supports mitochondrial function, reduces neuroinflammation, promotes inflammation. Resolution also promotes glutathione formation and magnesium absorption, and that would provide some collateral benefits.\n00:05:25\nAnd I also showed you in video #4A clinical study showing that vitamin D promotes recovery from virus infection and specifically the COVID-19 infection.\n00:05:36\nAnd finally, with regard to cellular and systemic health, I also showed you in video #1 how vitamin D alleviates chronic pain and pain amplification and in video #2 how vitamin D supplementation alleviates anxiety and depression. So I&#39;m going to focus today on viral infections, but a lot of this information would be essentially the same for bacterial and fungal infections.\n00:05:59\nSo before we leave this page, I want everybody to focus in on what I had said before and that is that vitamin D functions at virtually every level.\n00:06:08\nOf non specific defense.\n00:06:11\nViral inhibition and also immunity and systemic health.\n00:06:17\nSo again, in defense against an invading microbe, whether that&#39;s a fungus or a bacteria or a virus, the entire body has to work in unison, and that&#39;s why we&#39;re going to see our best clinical results from agents that improve health, defense and resilience at every level.\n00:06:36\nRole starting with the acquisition of the microbe. In the case of viruses inhibiting viral replication, which occurs through human molecular machinery and then again in response to all microbes specific and nonspecific defenses, and the cellular and systemic consequences and response. So again, the ideal agent, and in this case we&#39;re talking about vitamin D.\n00:06:59\nWould function at every level, blocking acquisition blocking replication of viruses, supporting specific and non specific immune defenses and also supporting cellular and systemic health.\n00:07:11\nNow again, this explains the biological plausibility of using vitamin D against infectious diseases. Let&#39;s add one more level of detail on the following page.\n00:07:22\nAgain, vitamin D functions at every level of barrier defense inhibiting viral replication also supporting innate and acquired immunity.\n00:07:31\nVitamin D also supports cellular and systemic health to reduce the burden, severity, frequency and consequences of infectious diseases, and here I&#39;ll show you that vitamin D supplementation specifically increases production of interferon gamma, so interferon gamma is a cytokine and the reason it&#39;s called interferon is because it interferes.\n00:07:52\nWith viral replication.\n00:07:56\nSo again, if you&#39;re trying to explain this to yourself, to a patient or to a professional colleague or a professional adversary, one of the things you could say if they need something kind of focused, you could say, well vitamin D improves gamma interferon production and you know, of course that the interferons block viral replication. So let&#39;s look at that.\n00:08:16\nYear from the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, April 2020 Vitamin D administration increases production of interferon gamma measured in the serum here. So I&#39;ll show you this article more, but I wanted to kind of force.\n00:08:29\nShadow it in this conversation again on biological plausibility and mechanisms. If someone needs a specific mechanism beyond what I&#39;ve already discussed, we can tell them that vitamin D supplementation increases production of interferon gamma and that interferon gamma has antiviral effects. So again, we&#39;ve got kind of the.\n00:08:49\nBiological plausibility here, and we have the clinical evidence here and I have much more where this came from. So let&#39;s look at a few more details specific to vitamin D and interferon, I showed you this study previously in video #4 we looked at this article from cytokine 2015.\n00:09:05\nShowing that supplemental vitamin D increased levels of interferon gamma and again, we know that interferon gamma is directly antiviral. So here&#39;s my definition of it. You can pause the video to take a read of that, but I want to show you a few highlights from a different article. This was published in Journal of Leukocyte Biology 2004, again the interferons.\n00:09:27\nAre cytokines that famously interfere with viral replication.\n00:09:32\nInterferon gamma also upregulates other aspects of the immune system for a more potent and efficient response to intracellular pathogens. And of course, all viruses are intracellular pathogens. Interferon gamma specifically supports the TH one or cell mediated type of immune response and again that&#39;s what we would expect against an intracellular.\n00:09:53\nAnd in video #3 I talked about antimicrobial peptides and other kind of non specific antimicrobial defenses, and we see that interferon gamma, which is supported by vitamin D supplementation, increases production of lysozyme, defensins and cathelicidins. Those are the classic antimicrobial peptides.\n00:10:12\nAs I&#39;ve said before, we want vitamin D levels to at least reach 40 nanograms per milliliter, or 100 nanomoles per liter.\n00:10:22\nThis is what I published in 2004. More recently, I think we should aim for an optimal physiologic range of 50 to 90 nanograms per milliliter, also known as 125 to 225 nanomoles per liter. That is the normal physiologic range for sun exposed humans.\n00:10:41\nAnd to get people into that range, we should have started population wide, vitamin D supplementation.\n00:10:47\nAt least 17 years ago, after I published this article in 2004 by failing to provide population wide vitamin D supplementation, we have invited pandemics of early death and infectious disease.\n00:11:01\nSo even though COVID-19 is obviously a new type of infection, the data on the relationship between COVID-19 and vitamin D is absolutely stunning and consistent.\n00:11:13\nAnd very, very robust. And now we actually have clinical evidence showing the benefit of vitamin D supplementation against COVID-19 even when patients are already presenting with symptoms. And actually some of them are being hospitalized for those symptoms.\n00:11:28\nSo we&#39;ll look at several different studies, but overall the data is very robust. Innumerable publications have demonstrated that low 25 hydroxy vitamin D is a risk factor for the incidence severity and mortality of COVID-19 infection. But medical organizations and governments have done.\n00:11:44\nWhile the entire world was saw on so-called lockdown and hundreds of millions of lives were disrupted, hundreds of thousands of deaths due to neglect and suicide and depression, we are far beyond scientific consensus on this topic, meaning that vitamin D is absolutely essential and effective against the initiation and.\n00:12:04\nProgression and fatal termination of COVID-19 infections. So what we&#39;re faced with here is political stagnation, not scientific stagnation. But of course, some of that research is politically.\n00:12:17\nActivated and I&#39;ll show you some examples of that. Let&#39;s look at this very important study published last year in Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in 2020. This was published in August out of southern Spain. This is a pilot study starting with 76 patients with COVID-19 in an area of Spain that typically has a vitamin D level.\n00:12:37\nBelow 15 nanograms per milli.\n00:12:41\nAnd So what they did here was a little bit unusual in both dosing and the type of vitamin D that they used. They used 25 hydroxy vitamin D they did not use vitamin D3, they used the semi activated or activated form 25 hydroxy vitamin D and they administered it in somewhat of an unusual way. Their tablets or their capsules were 266 micrograms.\n00:13:03\nSo patients receive two of those doses on the first day and then one on the third day, one on the 7th day and one on the 14th day.\n00:13:12\nAnd what they showed here was greater survival and less need for intensive care unit treatment.\n00:13:17\nSo this is excellent initial data and from this point forward, if we&#39;re really going to take COVID-19 seriously as a pandemic infection, this one study was actually sufficient to initiate action from this point forward. The international medical and political so-called communities could have reasonably.\n00:13:35\nStarted using vitamin.\n00:13:36\nTreatment, preventatively and therapeutically, rather than sit and do nothing, wait for a crisis telling these patients to go home until they&#39;re more sick and then come back for emergency care. That always results in higher mortality, so we could have taken action on this for more than a year. But the international medical and political so-called communities actively did nothing.\n00:13:57\nThey actively suppress this information.\n00:14:01\nHere&#39;s another study published in the British Medical Journal&#39;s postgraduate Medical Journal, 2020 November. This is a population of 40 patients with mild COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency. They were treated with 60,000 international units per day to reach an optimal.\n00:14:15\n25 hydroxy.\n00:14:16\nVitamin D level of at least 50 nanograms per milliliter, which is exactly the same as what I recommended.\n00:14:23\nAbout 10 years ago, in a publication for the American Chiropractic Association.\n00:14:27\nThe beneficial effect included the fact that 62% of participants in the intervention group receiving vitamin D versus 20% in the control arm became COVID-19 negative within a period of two weeks. So that is showing you a direct antiviral effect of vitamin D against COVID-19. Again, that is showing you a direct.\n00:14:48\nAnd clinically important direct antiviral effect of vitamin D against COVID-19 fibrinogen levels were also decrease.\n00:14:55\nReleased. So again, patients receiving vitamin D3 experienced triple the improvement in terms of becoming negative for COVID-19 and we all have to agree that that&#39;s one of the major goals is to make people virus negative so they don&#39;t have the virus and they&#39;re also not transmitting it.\n00:15:14\nSo here again was another international game changer that was actively ignored and suppressed by medical groups and politicians, essentially all of whom are paid by Big Pharma. My opinion is that denying this line of research now confirmed multiple times by multiple international investigators is a crime against all humans who are affected by luck.\n00:15:32\nTowns, travel, work and leisure restrictions and loss of income and the right to live their lives normally.\n00:15:39\nSo now let&#39;s look at another study using activated or semi activated vitamin D in the.\n00:15:44\nForm of 20.\n00:15:44\n5 hydroxyvitamin D This was conducted in 537 patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. So again this is another study out of Spain using 25 hydroxyvitamin D among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n00:15:59\nAnd the effect of supplementation.\n00:16:01\nWas a 78%.\n00:16:02\nReduction in death.\n00:16:04\nAgain, if this were a drug, it would be considered a miracle and I think very positively of these researchers, I think of them as global patriots trying to save the world by showing the world that this pandemic viral infection can be easily managed by the use of competent vitamin D supplementation. It&#39;s safe. It&#39;s beneficial, it&#39;s available.\n00:16:24\nIt&#39;s agreeable, and I think that if we were to just do it, we would change the course of this so-called global pandemic.\n00:16:32\nLet&#39;s look at another study here. This is from Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism, 2021. This is another remarkable study published out of Spain involving 838 COVID-19 hospitalized patients at the hospital, Del Mar and Barcelona.\n00:16:48\nAnd the effect is an 87% reduction in intensive care unit admission and a 79% reduction in mortality.\n00:16:58\nThese results are the most superior in terms of reduced ICU utilization, reduced mortality and cost effectiveness that have ever been documented for any therapy against COVID-19.

So if you want to look at these results graphically, they look.\n00:17:32\nLike this.

So thank you very much for your attention.

!!!!Transcript
00:00:00
Hello everyone, this is Doctor Alex Vasquez with part 5 and my clinical review of vitamin D deficiency in adults, this time focusing on nutritional neglect versus antimicrobial defense. These are without any doubt whatsoever the four major pillars of what we call clinical ethics or medical ethics.
00:00:20
Now we could extend this list to include a few others. Sometimes the list goes to seven, but the four indisputable basic pillars of medical ethics are non malfeasance, beneficence, justice and autonomy, which includes informed consent.
00:00:37
So how does vitamin D play into this model? Well, we know that vitamin D strengthens barriers. It strengthens the epithelial cells, and it also increases antimicrobial peptide production in this case, including secretory IGA, which is the immunoglobulin on mucosal surfaces such as the gastrointestinal tract, genital urinary tract.
00:00:56
Oral cavity and respiratory tract, including the lungs. Furthermore, we know that vitamin D strengthens tight junctions between the cells and also improves the microbiome and that of course has effects throughout the entire body.
00:01:09
In various models, 125 dihydroxyvitamin D inhibits viral replication and we know that it also inhibits the transcription factor in F Kappa B which participates in viral replication as well.
00:01:23
As I showed you in video #4 vitamin D also inhibits or modulates and lowers tumor diagnosis factor alpha, which is an endogenous factor. It&#39;s a cytokine that actually stimulates viral replication, so if we can modulate that or lower that or control that with vitamin D, then of course that would indirectly inhibit viral replication and that would give the immune system.
00:01:44
Kind of the upper hand or a strategic advantage and what I&#39;ll show you right now is the new data showing that vitamin D functions as a mechanistic antiviral or a pharmacologic antiviral against the COVID-19 virus. Let&#39;s take a look at that right now from the American Journal of Physiology, 2021. This was published in June.
00:02:03
And let&#39;s focus on the title showing that vitamin D metabolites can inhibit the SARS Co, V2 replication machinery enzymes. I&#39;ll read that to you one more time. Vitamin D metabolites can inhibit the SARS Co, V2 replication machinery. Enzymes. Let&#39;s focus in on their research.
00:02:22
Ratings metabolites of vitamin D and pre vitamin D produced in the skin following ultraviolet B exposure inhibited 2 key enzymes of the COVID-19 coronavirus, while 25 hydroxyvitamin D was impressively effective against both enzymes. Other UV B produced pre D3 metabolites were also potent.
00:02:44
And as I say here, in my own words, one could reasonably anticipate a synergistic or entourage effect.
00:02:50
Now let me show you 2 tables from this article here. In their table one they show binding affinities of various agents against the SARS Co V enzyme M Pro, as they&#39;ve stated here.
00:03:02
And again, this is specific to a replicative enzyme used by the SARS Co V2 virus called M Pro. Now let&#39;s look at the evidence against another enzyme here. So this is binding affinity of various drugs and metabolites against the COVID-19 enzyme Rd. RP. Again, in comparison with some standard antiviral drugs.
00:03:25
And lo and behold, we noticed that 25 hydroxyvitamin D, which is the dominant metabolite of vitamin D in the blood. We noticed that that particular metabolite is actually the most potent inhibitor or binder of the sensyu, again in SARS COVID 2 or the COVID-19 virus Rd. RP.
00:03:45
25 hydroxy vitamin D3 is something that we can increase in the serum very quickly through the use of nutritional supplementation and again it is the most potent metabolic.
00:03:54
Against this particular enzyme of the COVID-19 virus, more effective than other vitamin D metabolites and more effective than all of the antiviral drugs tested in this model.
00:04:07
So I invite you to take a look at that article if you have interest in it. Again, it was recently published American Journal of Physiology, 2021 in June, again published by the American Physiological Society. So let&#39;s continue my diagram explanation here again, supporting the biological plausibility of vitamin D use against viral infections.
00:04:28
So I&#39;ve already discussed the acquisition step or the direct antiviral step I talked about how vitamin D can directly and indirectly inhibit replication. Now let&#39;s talk about Immuno nutrition.
00:04:40
So we know that vitamin D improves antigen presentation cell mediated immunity immune globulin mediated immunity as well, and occasionally some studies have shown that vitamin D improves the response to vaccines, and that&#39;s what we would expect given what I&#39;ve said above, and that is it improves antigen presentation as well as antibody.
00:05:01
Mediated immunity.
00:05:04
And as I reviewed in great detail in video #4, we know that vitamin D modulates or reduces inflammation at the cellular and systemic level. We know that vitamin D supports mitochondrial function, reduces neuroinflammation, promotes inflammation. Resolution also promotes glutathione formation and magnesium absorption, and that would provide some collateral benefits.
00:05:25
And I also showed you in video #4A clinical study showing that vitamin D promotes recovery from virus infection and specifically the COVID-19 infection.
00:05:36
And finally, with regard to cellular and systemic health, I also showed you in video #1 how vitamin D alleviates chronic pain and pain amplification and in video #2 how vitamin D supplementation alleviates anxiety and depression. So I&#39;m going to focus today on viral infections, but a lot of this information would be essentially the same for bacterial and fungal infections.
00:05:59
So before we leave this page, I want everybody to focus in on what I had said before and that is that vitamin D functions at virtually every level.
00:06:08
Of non specific defense.
00:06:11
Viral inhibition and also immunity and systemic health.
00:06:17
So again, in defense against an invading microbe, whether that&#39;s a fungus or a bacteria or a virus, the entire body has to work in unison, and that&#39;s why we&#39;re going to see our best clinical results from agents that improve health, defense and resilience at every level.
00:06:36
Role starting with the acquisition of the microbe. In the case of viruses inhibiting viral replication, which occurs through human molecular machinery and then again in response to all microbes specific and nonspecific defenses, and the cellular and systemic consequences and response. So again, the ideal agent, and in this case we&#39;re talking about vitamin D.
00:06:59
Would function at every level, blocking acquisition blocking replication of viruses, supporting specific and non specific immune defenses and also supporting cellular and systemic health.
00:07:11
Now again, this explains the biological plausibility of using vitamin D against infectious diseases. Let&#39;s add one more level of detail on the following page.
00:07:22
Again, vitamin D functions at every level of barrier defense inhibiting viral replication also supporting innate and acquired immunity.
00:07:31
Vitamin D also supports cellular and systemic health to reduce the burden, severity, frequency and consequences of infectious diseases, and here I&#39;ll show you that vitamin D supplementation specifically increases production of interferon gamma, so interferon gamma is a cytokine and the reason it&#39;s called interferon is because it interferes.
00:07:52
With viral replication.
00:07:56
So again, if you&#39;re trying to explain this to yourself, to a patient or to a professional colleague or a professional adversary, one of the things you could say if they need something kind of focused, you could say, well vitamin D improves gamma interferon production and you know, of course that the interferons block viral replication. So let&#39;s look at that.
00:08:16
Year from the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, April 2020 Vitamin D administration increases production of interferon gamma measured in the serum here. So I&#39;ll show you this article more, but I wanted to kind of force.
00:08:29
Shadow it in this conversation again on biological plausibility and mechanisms. If someone needs a specific mechanism beyond what I&#39;ve already discussed, we can tell them that vitamin D supplementation increases production of interferon gamma and that interferon gamma has antiviral effects. So again, we&#39;ve got kind of the.
00:08:49
Biological plausibility here, and we have the clinical evidence here and I have much more where this came from. So let&#39;s look at a few more details specific to vitamin D and interferon, I showed you this study previously in video #4 we looked at this article from cytokine 2015.
00:09:05
Showing that supplemental vitamin D increased levels of interferon gamma and again, we know that interferon gamma is directly antiviral. So here&#39;s my definition of it. You can pause the video to take a read of that, but I want to show you a few highlights from a different article. This was published in Journal of Leukocyte Biology 2004, again the interferons.
00:09:27
Are cytokines that famously interfere with viral replication.
00:09:32
Interferon gamma also upregulates other aspects of the immune system for a more potent and efficient response to intracellular pathogens. And of course, all viruses are intracellular pathogens. Interferon gamma specifically supports the TH one or cell mediated type of immune response and again that&#39;s what we would expect against an intracellular.
00:09:53
And in video #3 I talked about antimicrobial peptides and other kind of non specific antimicrobial defenses, and we see that interferon gamma, which is supported by vitamin D supplementation, increases production of lysozyme, defensins and cathelicidins. Those are the classic antimicrobial peptides.
00:10:12
As I&#39;ve said before, we want vitamin D levels to at least reach 40 nanograms per milliliter, or 100 nanomoles per liter.
00:10:22
This is what I published in 2004. More recently, I think we should aim for an optimal physiologic range of 50 to 90 nanograms per milliliter, also known as 125 to 225 nanomoles per liter. That is the normal physiologic range for sun exposed humans.
00:10:41
And to get people into that range, we should have started population wide, vitamin D supplementation.
00:10:47
At least 17 years ago, after I published this article in 2004 by failing to provide population wide vitamin D supplementation, we have invited pandemics of early death and infectious disease.
00:11:01
So even though COVID-19 is obviously a new type of infection, the data on the relationship between COVID-19 and vitamin D is absolutely stunning and consistent.
00:11:13
And very, very robust. And now we actually have clinical evidence showing the benefit of vitamin D supplementation against COVID-19 even when patients are already presenting with symptoms. And actually some of them are being hospitalized for those symptoms.
00:11:28
So we&#39;ll look at several different studies, but overall the data is very robust. Innumerable publications have demonstrated that low 25 hydroxy vitamin D is a risk factor for the incidence severity and mortality of COVID-19 infection. But medical organizations and governments have done.
00:11:44
While the entire world was saw on so-called lockdown and hundreds of millions of lives were disrupted, hundreds of thousands of deaths due to neglect and suicide and depression, we are far beyond scientific consensus on this topic, meaning that vitamin D is absolutely essential and effective against the initiation and.
00:12:04
Progression and fatal termination of COVID-19 infections. So what we&#39;re faced with here is political stagnation, not scientific stagnation. But of course, some of that research is politically.
00:12:17
Activated and I&#39;ll show you some examples of that. Let&#39;s look at this very important study published last year in Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in 2020. This was published in August out of southern Spain. This is a pilot study starting with 76 patients with COVID-19 in an area of Spain that typically has a vitamin D level.
00:12:37
Below 15 nanograms per milli.
00:12:41
And So what they did here was a little bit unusual in both dosing and the type of vitamin D that they used. They used 25 hydroxy vitamin D they did not use vitamin D3, they used the semi activated or activated form 25 hydroxy vitamin D and they administered it in somewhat of an unusual way. Their tablets or their capsules were 266 micrograms.
00:13:03
So patients receive two of those doses on the first day and then one on the third day, one on the 7th day and one on the 14th day.
00:13:12
And what they showed here was greater survival and less need for intensive care unit treatment.
00:13:17
So this is excellent initial data and from this point forward, if we&#39;re really going to take COVID-19 seriously as a pandemic infection, this one study was actually sufficient to initiate action from this point forward. The international medical and political so-called communities could have reasonably.
00:13:35
Started using vitamin.
00:13:36
Treatment, preventatively and therapeutically, rather than sit and do nothing, wait for a crisis telling these patients to go home until they&#39;re more sick and then come back for emergency care. That always results in higher mortality, so we could have taken action on this for more than a year. But the international medical and political so-called communities actively did nothing.
00:13:57
They actively suppress this information.
00:14:01
Here&#39;s another study published in the British Medical Journal&#39;s postgraduate Medical Journal, 2020 November. This is a population of 40 patients with mild COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency. They were treated with 60,000 international units per day to reach an optimal.
00:14:15
25 hydroxy.
00:14:16
Vitamin D level of at least 50 nanograms per milliliter, which is exactly the same as what I recommended.
00:14:23
About 10 years ago, in a publication for the American Chiropractic Association.
00:14:27
The beneficial effect included the fact that 62% of participants in the intervention group receiving vitamin D versus 20% in the control arm became COVID-19 negative within a period of two weeks. So that is showing you a direct antiviral effect of vitamin D against COVID-19. Again, that is showing you a direct.
00:14:48
And clinically important direct antiviral effect of vitamin D against COVID-19 fibrinogen levels were also decrease.
00:14:55
Released. So again, patients receiving vitamin D3 experienced triple the improvement in terms of becoming negative for COVID-19 and we all have to agree that that&#39;s one of the major goals is to make people virus negative so they don&#39;t have the virus and they&#39;re also not transmitting it.
00:15:14
So here again was another international game changer that was actively ignored and suppressed by medical groups and politicians, essentially all of whom are paid by Big Pharma. My opinion is that denying this line of research now confirmed multiple times by multiple international investigators is a crime against all humans who are affected by luck.
00:15:32
Towns, travel, work and leisure restrictions and loss of income and the right to live their lives normally.
00:15:39
So now let&#39;s look at another study using activated or semi activated vitamin D in the.
00:15:44
Form of 20.
00:15:44
5 hydroxyvitamin D This was conducted in 537 patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. So again this is another study out of Spain using 25 hydroxyvitamin D among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
00:15:59
And the effect of supplementation.
00:16:01
Was a 78%.
00:16:02
Reduction in death.
00:16:04
Again, if this were a drug, it would be considered a miracle and I think very positively of these researchers, I think of them as global patriots trying to save the world by showing the world that this pandemic viral infection can be easily managed by the use of competent vitamin D supplementation. It&#39;s safe. It&#39;s beneficial, it&#39;s available.
00:16:24
It&#39;s agreeable, and I think that if we were to just do it, we would change the course of this so-called global pandemic.
00:16:32
Let&#39;s look at another study here. This is from Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism, 2021. This is another remarkable study published out of Spain involving 838 COVID-19 hospitalized patients at the hospital, Del Mar and Barcelona.
00:16:48
And the effect is an 87% reduction in intensive care unit admission and a 79% reduction in mortality.
00:16:58
These results are the most superior in terms of reduced ICU utilization, reduced mortality and cost effectiveness that have ever been documented for any therapy against COVID-19. To the best of my knowledge.
00:17:13
And here we are again. From this point forward, the international medical and political communities should have reasonably started using vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 rather than sit and do nothing, wait for the continuation of the crisis, and then use emergency care with high mortality. So if you want to look at these results graphically, they look.
00:17:32
Like this. This is the 15% mortality without vitamin D reduced to a 5% mortality with vitamin D.
00:17:40
Along with an 87% reduction in intensive care unit utilization, so that represents massive savings in healthcare utilization and expense, again with a 79% reduction in death. If this had been a drug study or a vaccine study, these researchers would have won the Nobel Prize, but because it was a vitamin D study, it was ignored.
00:18:02
So that brings us to a close today. Remember, we&#39;ve been talking about this now for 17 years, at least talking about the importance of giving patients the vitamin D that they need so we can avoid the disease predispositions that are predictable and which contribute to these global pandemics of various types of disease, not simply COVID-19.
00:18:22
So this was published.
00:18:23
Last year in nutrients in November of 2020, vitamin D insufficiency may account for almost 9 of 10 COVID-19 deaths time to act. Given the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and the proven safety of vitamin D segmentation, it therefore appears highly debatable and potentially even unethical.
00:18:42
To await results of such trials, even before public health action is taken. But we already have the clinical studies and I&#39;ve reviewed them with you here. So again, for acute dosing, we use 60,000 international units per day for 14 days or we use the semi activated form of 25 hydroxy vitamin D.
00:18:59
At roughly the equivalent of 5000 to 9000, international units per day, we know that this is safe, beneficial, available, agreeable and therefore clinically justified. So thank you very much for your attention. This has been part number 5 in my clinical review of vitamin D deficiency in adults, this time focusing on antimicrobial defense versus nutritional neglect.
00:19:21
Based on the mountain of research we have, showing the many benefits of vitamin D supplementation.
00:19:27
Thank you very much and again, this has been Doctor Alex Vasquez and I look forward to sharing more research with you soon.
00:19:33
Meanwhile, please take a look at my blog at healthythinking.substacks.com. You can also find my books and all major booksellers worldwide, and you can also see more information on my other main website, whichisinflammationmastery.com. Thank you again.
