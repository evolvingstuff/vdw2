20,000 IU vitamin D daily for a week

20,000 IU vitamin D weekly for 6 months

 **Far better  results would be expected if had done 1 or more of the following:** 

1. Had used a type of vitamin D compatible with poorly functioning liver

1. Had used a larger daily loading dose - e.g. 50,000 IU

1. Had used daily loading dose for a longer time period e.g. 2 weeks

1. Had used a larger weekly maintenance dose - e.g. 50,000 IU

1. Had used dose sizes proportional to weight (obese need 2.5 X more)

INTRODUCTION:

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in Western countries. A meta-analysis has confirmed decreased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in NAFLD patients. This intervention study investigates whether vitamin D correction ameliorates hepatic steatosis.

METHODS:

We prospectively recruited 40 patients from an outpatient liver clinic with vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/ml). Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) during transient elastography quantified hepatic steatosis. Patients with significant liver fat accumulation were included, which was defined by a CAP value >/= 280 dB/m. Patients received 20,000 IU vitamin D/week for six months, while vitamin D status, liver function tests (LFTs), CAP and body composition were monitored.

RESULTS:

The cohort comprised 47.5% women (age 54.9 +/- 12.1 years; BMI 29.5 +/- 3.0 kg/m2). Mean serum vitamin D level was 11.8 +/- 4.8 ng/ml. CAP decreased significantly from baseline (330 +/- 32 vs. 307 +/- 41 dB/m) during supplementation (P = 0.007). A mean CAP reduction relative to baseline was demonstrated at four weeks and three and six months: -5.3 +/- 13.8%; -6.0 +/- 14.6% and -6.4 +/- 13.0%, respectively. During these time points, restoration of serum vitamin D levels was observed (34.6 +/- 12.9, 36.3 +/- 10.2, 34.8 +/- 9.8 ng/ml; P < 0.0001). Liver function tests and body composition remained unchanged.

CONCLUSIONS:

Hepatic steatosis, as assessed by CAP, significantly improves after only 4 weeks of vitamin D correction. Hepatic steatosis is a dynamic process, that can be monitored in the short-term using such non-invasive methods.
