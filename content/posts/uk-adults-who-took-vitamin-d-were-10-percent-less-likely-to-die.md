 **Note: Decreased respiratory mortality by 29%** 

Background: Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation for reduced cancer mortality, all-cause mortality, and respiratory tract infections. However, whether and to what extent this translates into effectiveness in real-world practice is unknown.

Methods: We assessed the association of vitamin D supplements use (as an over-the-counter drug or as part of a multivitamin product), vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) < 30 nmol/L) and insufficiency (25(OH)D 30-<50 nmol/L) with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in 445,601 participants, aged 40-73 years, from the UK Biobank cohort.

Results: 4.3% and further 20.4% of the study participants reported regularly taking vitamin D or multivitamin supplements, respectively. Still, the majority had either vitamin D deficiency (21.0%) or insufficiency (34.3%). We detected 49 independent determinants of vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D supplement use and used them to adjust Cox regression models for all mortality outcomes. 29,107 (6.5%) participants died during a median follow-up time of 11.8 years. 

Both vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were strongly associated with all mortality outcomes. 

 **Self-reported vitamin D supplements use**  (83% over-the-counter/17% prescription drugs) and multivitamin intake were significantly associated with  **10%**  and 5% lower all-cause mortality, respectively. Furthermore, regular vitamin D supplement users had 11%, 11% and 29% lower cancer, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease mortality than non-users, respectively (not significant for cardiovascular disease mortality).

Conclusion: This large study suggests that in the real world, the efficacy of vitamin D supplements in reducing mortality may be at least as good as observed in RCTs.

#### 500,000 in UK Biobank, aged 40-69, 2006-2010, only 4.3% took Vitamin D

Note: Those people taking Vitamin D probably reduced their mortality in other ways as well:

* Exercise

* Better foods

* Taking Omega-3
