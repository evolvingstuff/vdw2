Multiple factors are involved in determining serum uric acid levels including age, sex, renal function, and dietetic factors such as fructose, purine, and alcohol intake. Excessive purine intake, endogenous defects in purine metabolism, and/or inadequate uric acid excretion lead to hyperuricemia <sup>[1]</sup>. Thus, an abnormal uric acid concentration may be associated with several disorders such as hyperuricemia, gout, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease <sup>[2]</sup>, <sup>[3]</sup>, <sup>[4]</sup>. The usual treatment for hyperuricemia consists of the administration of uric acid-lowering drugs, however, it has been reported that therapeutic interventions to reduce uric acid concentrations are underused in patients recently diagnosed with hyperuricemia <sup>[5]</sup>.</p><p>Recently, other therapeutic options have shown a beneficial effect in decreasing serum uric acid levels, including vitamin D supplementation <sup>[6]</sup>. Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that in addition to regulating calcium and phosphorus absorption and bone metabolism, exerts many pleiotropic actions in organs and tissues in the body. The recommendation for the pleiotropic effects of vitamin D is a target 25(OH)D concentration of 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L), and age-, body weight-, disease-status, and ethnicity using vitamin D doses between 400 and 2000 IU/day <sup>[7]</sup>. A large population-based study indicated that the serum 25(OH) D, dietary vitamin D intake, vitamin D supplementation, and total vitamin D intake were inversely associated with hyperuricemia in men, while inverse associations between 25(OH) D, dietary vitamin D intake, and total vitamin D intake with hyperuricemia were observed in women <sup>[8]</sup>. However, evidence in this field is still scarce; therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis of clinical trials was to examine the effect of vitamin D administration on serum uric acid concentrations.</p><p><strong>Section snippets</strong></p><p>Search strategy</p><p>We performed the present study According to the Systematic Review of Controlled Trials - PRISMA - Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines <sup>[9]</sup>.

However, previous studies have been controversial, with limited focus on children and adolescents.</p><p>Objective: This study aimed to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between serum vitamin D and serum uric acid (SUA) levels in children and adolescents.</p><p>Methods: The cross-sectional survey comprised 4777 participants aged 6 to 18 years, while the longitudinal survey involved 1641 participants aged 6 to 12 years, all derived from an ongoing cohort study in Shenzhen, China. Restricted cubic splines were used to visualize the dose-response relationship between vitamin D and SUA and the risk of higher SUA status. Two-segment generalized linear models (GLM) and logistic models were used to assess the association between vitamin D and SUA and higher SUA status, respectively. The longitudinal analysis used GLM.</p><p>Results: We observed an inverted U-shaped relationship between vitamin D and SUA (p-overall &lt; 0.0001, p-nonlinear = 0.0002), as well as the risk of higher SUA status (p-overall = 0.0054, p-nonlinear = 0.0015), with the vitamin D inflection point at 24.31 and 21.29 ng/mL, respectively. A 10 ng/mL increment in 25(OH)D3 levels, when below 20.92 ng/mL, was associated with a 68% rise in the risk of higher SUA status (OR: 1.68, 95%CI: 1.07-2.66). Conversely, when 25(OH)D3 levels were above or equal to 20.92 ng/mL, a 10 ng/mL increment was associated with a 45% reduction risk of higher SUA status (OR: 0.55, 95%CI: 0.36-0.84). Longitudinal analysis indicated that the annual change of SUA was from -4.80 (β, 95%CI: -10.74, 1.13) to -9.00 (β, 95%CI: -15.03, -2.99) and then to -6.77 (β, 95%CI: -12.83, -0.71, p for trend = 0.0212) μmol/L when increasing the quartile of vitamin D3.</p><p>Conclusions: An inverse U-shaped relationship was observed between vitamin D and SUA as well as the risk of higher SUA status. Sufficient vitamin D levels appear to play a preventative role against the age-related increase in SUA. Ensuring adequate vitamin D levels may be beneficial in improving uric acid metabolism.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/uric-acid-u-shape-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=potential-causal-associations-between-vitamin-d-and-uric-acid-bidirectional-mediation-analysis---sept-2015>Potential causal associations between vitamin D and uric acid: Bidirectional mediation analysis - Sept 2015</h4><p><strong><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26417870>PDF</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=association-between-vitamin-d-and-hyperuricemia-among-adults-in-the-united-states--nov-2020>Association Between Vitamin D and Hyperuricemia Among Adults in the United States- Nov 2020</h4><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/excess-uric-acid-and-vitamin-d.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/excess-uric-acid.jpg alt=image width=700><hr><h4 id=uric-acid-and-vitamin-d-linked-to-pth---july-2021>Uric acid and Vitamin D linked to PTH - July 2021</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D and Uric Acid: Is Parathyroid Hormone the Missing Link?</strong></p><p>Journal of Clinical & Translational Endocrinology.

The current systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted with the aim to summarize all the available data.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE database from inception to May 2018 to identify all studies that compared the level of serum uric acid between individuals with normal vitamin D level and patients with vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency. Eligible studies must be cohort or cross-sectional studies that consisted of two groups of adult participants, one with normal level of vitamin D (vitamin D level >30 ng/ml) and one with vitamin D insufficiency (vitamin D level 20-30 ng/ml) or vitamin D deficiency (vitamin D level of &lt;20 ng/ml). Mean serum uric acid level and standard deviation of participants were extracted from each study to calculate mean difference (MD). Pooled MD was then calculated by combining MDs of each study using random-effects model.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>A total of seven cross-sectional studies were eligible for the meta-analyses. Individuals with normal vitamin D level had a significantly lower serum uric acid level than patients with vitamin D insufficiency with the pooled MD of -0.33 mg/dl (95%CI, -0.61, -0.04), and also had a significantly lower serum uric acid level than patients with vitamin D deficiency with the pooled MD of -0.45 mg/dl (95%CI, -0.82, -0.08). The statistical heterogeneity of these meta-analyses was high with the I2 of 78% and 89%, respectively. Funnel plots of both meta-analyses were fairly symmetric and did not provide a suggestive evidence for the presence of publication bias.</p><p>CONCLUSION: Both patients with vitamin D insufficiency and patients with vitamin D deficiency had a significantly higher level of serum uric acid compared with individuals with normal vitamin D level.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/low-d-high-uric-rg.pdf>Download the PDF from Research Gate via VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>alcohol</span>
