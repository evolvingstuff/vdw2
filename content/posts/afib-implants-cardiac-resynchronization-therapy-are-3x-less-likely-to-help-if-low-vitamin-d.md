#### Vitamin D as a predictor of clinical response among patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)

J Arrhythm. 2024 Jul 16;40(4):975-981. [doi: 10.1002/joa3.13116.](https://doi.org/10.1002/joa3.13116.)

Introduction: Cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidities have been recognized as predictors of clinical response in patients receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). However, data on vitamin D as a predictor of CRT response are conflicting.

Method: We identified studies from MEDLINE and Embase databases, searching from inception to May 2024, to investigate the association between 25-OH vitamin D levels before CRT implantation and outcomes. Studies had to report 25-OH vitamin D levels or the proportion of patients with vitamin D insufficiency and categorize outcomes as CRT responders or nonresponders. We extracted mean 25-OH vitamin D and standard deviations for both groups from each study and calculated the pooled mean difference (MD). We also retrieved risk ratios, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between vitamin D insufficiency and lack of CRT response, combining them using the generic inverse variance method.

Results: Our meta-analysis included four studies. CRT responders had higher levels of 25-OH vitamin D than nonresponders, with a pooled MD of 8.04 ng/mL (95% CI: 3.16-12.93; I 2 = 48%, p < .001). Patients with vitamin D insufficiency before implantation had higher odds of lacking response to CRT, with a pooled  **RR of 3.28**  (95% CI: 1.43-7.50; I 2 = 0%, p = .005) compared to those with normal vitamin D.

Conclusions: CRT responders had higher 25-OH vitamin D levels compared to nonresponders. Vitamin D insufficiency was associated with a higher risk of nonresponse to CRT. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring and managing vitamin D levels in these patients.
