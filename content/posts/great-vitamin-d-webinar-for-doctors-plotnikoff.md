#### Update - new webinar [Vitamin D Webinar - Plotnikoff - Feb 29 2016](/posts/vitamin-d-webinar-plotnikoff)

### The Shocking Truth About Vitamin D Status

Some notes of excellent 90 minute Vitamin D webinar for doctors with CME credit

Webinar by Dr. Greg Plotnikoff, [Vitamin D Webinars by DiaSorin 2013-2014](/posts/vitamin-d-webinars-by-diasorin-2013-2014)

* Vitamin D is a Nature Deficient Disorder

* Safe sunning, no burning

* Rickets making a comeback – Plotnikoff asked viewer to guess which year

* IoM  in 2010 lowered 30ng ==> 20 ng, but tripled recommend amount for elderly

* Cutting edge research in Vitamin D Binding Protein

* At least 1,000 KEY genes controlled by Vitamin D

*  **5 current controversies** 

1. Who has the normal level of vitamin D: office workers, lifeguards, farmers

1. What is sufficiency. So far they just use the  **index diseases** : generally short incidence (ignore lot latency diseases)

1. JAMA: 1940 2 paragraphs in a paper noticed that there was  400 IU of vitamin D in cod liver oil 

> That became the standard for the next 70 years

1. 15 minutes in the sun – latitude issues, clouds, haze (Hong Kong down 20%)

1. Skin Color

* His study: >40 ng would have save $2.5 million  by increase presentment in just one workplace 

> The study included Health professionals, insured, etc  yet still very low levels of vitamin D

* BMI is increasing – which lowers vitamin D levels

* Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, but body clears it – homeostatic protection mechanisms

> 60 ng should be not harmful – we have had 10,000 generations out in the sun

* Calcium absorption increases by 65% when vitamin D level raised 20 ng==> 30 ng

* WHO has stated that only need 500 mg Calcium for vitamin D replete women 

* Denominator dispute with IoM about how many cadavers need 20 ng vs 30 ng of vitamin D

> Even the author of cadaver paper disagreed with IoM, felt than 30 ng was needed

* $40 million diabetes trial – Plotnikoff thinks it will be a good trial

* Tanning booth were originally Vitamin D booths (statement by VitaminDWiki, not Plotnikoff)

* Why not be sure your are sufficient if you are having any medical emergency/concern

* Chronic non-specific pain reduced with vitamin D– his publication – the biggest in MAYO ever?

* Hypothesis: Statin blocks cholesterol needed to make Vitamin D

* He has authored a book: Trust your gut 

> [Trust Your Gut: Get Lasting Healing from IBS and Other Chronic Digestive Problems Without Drugs](http://smile.amazon.com/Trust-Your-Gut-Digestive-Problems/dp/1573245887/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451916724&sr=8-1&keywords=Trust+your+gut) 

> April 2013, very little about Vitamin D

* No one dose fits all:  600 a day vs 6,000 a day

* Need a test.  By example, cannot tell Cholesterol  or other levels  by just looking at at a patient

* RA also varies with latitude

* Not get vitamin D from food: Are you going to eat 60 eggs a day – I don’t think so

* Good dose of vitamin D for entire pregnancy would cost less than $5

* Vitamin D2 had been used to escape from concerns about D3 toxicity (is this true?)

* His own FAMILY requires more vitamin D: ethnicity and genes

* 1/3 of herbal medicines from East Asian used to have sun-exposed mushrooms

> Herbal medicines used to have has lot of vitamin D

> however now the herbal medicines are prepared in ovens

* Upstream levels of vitamin D can be normal – but local regulation is unknown clinically

> So just testing will not ensure that all cells get access to vitamin D

* Mental Health and vitamin D – looks promising

* Perhaps Vitamin D also important in Gluten-free – similar to gut problems

* Vitamin D level of farmers and lifeguards is much higher than IoM level
