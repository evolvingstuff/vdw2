When I was in medical school, some of the scholastic tests were multiple choice, some were essay and some were matching. 

### There was one commonality when it came to vitamin D.

 **The only fact that was disseminated in medical school regarding vitamin D is that it  assisted calcium into our bones and it was obtained through sunlight.   
Therefore, if there was any answer associated with calcium in bones it had to be vitamin D.   
That was an easy one. It's all we knew.**
