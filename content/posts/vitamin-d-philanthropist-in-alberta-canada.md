#### [Vitamin Determination: An oilman becomes a health care renegade](http://www.macleans.ca/society/health/vitamin-determination-an-oilman-becomes-a-health-care-renegade/%20)

 **Allan Markin is one of Alberta’s richest men—and a crusader to get Canadians to take more vitamin D. Misguided eccentric, or visionary?** 

Jane Macdougall. May 26, 2015 macleans

 **Notes by Henry Lahore of VitaminDWiki** 

Markin wants to save Alberta and Canada lots of suffering and money

His net worth = $600 million

He has put $200 million into not-for profit healthcare (Pure North)

His purpose is similar to VitaminDWiki: to help people feel better and live longer

Pure North uses Vitamin D doses of 6,000 up to 20,000 IU daily 

He learned that productivity was linked to wellness while co-creating a oil/gas company

He personally got better after taking vitamin D and removing mercury fillings in his teeth

He believes that there are widespread health problems.

Naysayers still say we lack Vitamin D RCT

Still need prescription for >1,000 IU in Canada
