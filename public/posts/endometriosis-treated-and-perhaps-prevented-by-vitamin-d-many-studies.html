MDa,*; Siam, Haneen A. MDa; Ashhab, Yasmeen S. MDa; Sweity, Raneen R. MDa; Naasan, Mashhour MDb</p><p>Background:</p><p>Vitamin D supplementation is supposed to have an important role in the management of several endometriosis-related aspects, offering potential relief to affected individuals. Herein, the authors aim to evaluate the impact of vitamin D on pregnancy rates and clinical symptoms in women with endometriosis.</p><p>Methods: The authors extensively searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, and CINAHL from their inception to 20 July 2023.</p><p>Results:</p><p>Three randomized controlled trials involving 167 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The findings demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation exhibits efficacy in alleviating dysmenorrhea associated with endometriosis, as evidenced by a meta-analysis showing a significant reduction in dysmenorrhea (mean difference −1.41, 95% CI −2.61 to −0.22, P = 0.02). However, the impact on dyspareunia was inconclusive, with a non-significant mean difference of –0.2 (95% CI −1.62 to 1.22, P = 0.78). In contrast, dyschezia significantly decreased with vitamin D supplementation (mean difference −1.10, 95% CI −2.22 to 0.02, P = 0.05 However, the meta-analysis did not show a significant effect of vitamin D on chronic pelvic pain associated with endometriosis.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>While antioxidant vitamin D supplementation demonstrates general effectiveness in alleviating endometriosis symptoms, such as dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and dyschezia, the existing literature lacks direct investigations into the specific impact of vitamin D on enhancing pregnancy rates among endometriosis patients. This observation prompts various hypotheses, suggesting that the positive effects of vitamin D supplementation on endometriosis-related symptoms may indirectly contribute to improved pregnancy outcomes and enhanced fertility.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/baggy-table.webp>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p><strong>1 trial: 50,000 IU weekly,   2nd trial: 50,000 IU bi-weekly</strong></p><p><strong>Clipped from PDF:</strong> &ldquo;.

The aim of this systematic review is to critically appraise and qualitatively synthesize the results of the available studies that examine the supplementation of vit D for endometriosis treatment.</p><p>Methods: A systematic search of the literature was conducted in four electronic databases (Medline, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase) and grey literature for original research articles on humans, animals and in vitro models published in any language.</p><p>Results: Four human studies, four animal studies and four in vitro studies were included. Quantitative synthesis of human studies showed no significant effect of vit D intake for dysmenorrhea (2 studies, 44 vit D vs 44 placebo, mean -0.71, 95% CI -1.94, 0.51) and non-cyclic pelvic pain (2 studies, 42 vit D vs 38 placebo, mean 0.34, 95% CI -0.02, 0.71). Regarding reproductive outcomes in women with endometriosis after in vitro fertilization, the only available study showed no differences between women taking vit D and women taking placebo. Three of the four included animal studies showed regression of endometriotic implants when treated with vit D. The in vitro studies demonstrated that vit D decreases invasion and proliferation of endometriotic lesions without affecting apoptosis.</p><p>Conclusions: Although in vitro and animal studies suggest regression of the endometriotic implants and decrease of invasion and proliferation after vit D supplementation, this was not reflected in the results of the meta-analysis, which showed no benefit of vit D supplementation in patients with endometriosis and dysmenorrhea or non-cyclic pelvic pain as well as on the outcome of IVF treatment. However, given the heterogeneity and the diversity of the available studies, more research is required to shed light on the role of vit D supplementation in women with endometriosis.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/endometriosi-systematic-review-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=nutrition-including-vitamin-d-needed--to-prevent-endometriosis---dec-2022>Nutrition (including Vitamin D) needed to prevent Endometriosis - Dec 2022</h4><p><strong>I Am the 1 in 10—What Should I Eat?

Vitamin D receptor and vitamin D metabolizing enzymes, 24-hydroxylase and 1-α hydroxylase, are found in the normal cycling endometrium and also in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. The endometrium is a target of 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D actions through regulation of specific genes and via immunomodulation. The endometrium in endometriosis expresses dysregulation of some vitamin D enzymes and receptors. If vitamin D and its metabolites are implicated in endometriosis-associated infertility, it is likely through interference with HOXA10 gene expression. The Gc2 phenotype of vitamin D binding protein is prevalent in women with endometriosis and may be implicated in its pathogenesis. <strong>In a mouse model, Elocalcitol, a VDR-agonist was shown to reduce the development of endometriotic lesions and recurrence.</strong></p><p>Conclusion: A biological plausibility for a role of vitamin D, as an immunomodulator and anti-inflammatory agent, in the pathogenesis and treatment of endometriosis is suggested in this article, but is difficult to illustrate due to sparse evidence from human studies limited primarily to case–control studies. A significant knowledge gap precludes the establishment of a clear cause–effect relationship. The intriguing leads presented herein need to be investigated further with placebo-controlled supplementation trials.</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/endo-t1.jpg alt=image>

Endometriosis was surgically induced by implanting endometrial tissue on the abdominal peritoneum. Four weeks later, a second laparotomy was performed to assess pre-treatment implant volumes and cytokine levels. The rats were randomized into three groups: vitamin D group (42 μg/kg/day), omega-3 PUFA group <strong>(450 mg/kg/day)</strong> , and control group (saline 0.1 mL/rat/day). These treatments were administered for 4 weeks. At the end of treatment, a third laparotomy was performed for the assessment of cytokine levels, implant volumes (post-treatment) and implants were totally excised for histopathologic examination. Pre- and post-treatment volumes, cytokine levels within the groups, as well as stromal and glandular tissues between the groups were compared.</p><p>Results: The mean post-treatment volume was statistically significantly reduced in the omega-3 PUFA group (p = 0.02) and the level of the interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the peritoneal fluid were significantly decreased at the end of treatment in the omega-3 PUFA group (p = 0.02, p = 0.03, and p = 0.03, respectively). In the vitamin D group, only IL-6 levels were significantly decreased.

The disease has even been suggested to share some characteristics with malignant tumours, such as invasion of local and distant organs, abnormal tissue growth, dysfunction of target organs, and genetic damage <sup>[2]</sup>.</p><p>This review suggests that women with endometriosis are generally at higher risk of ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and skin melanoma, but that they are at decreased risk of cervical cancer.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In reviewing available evidence both the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology Guidelines <sup>[3]</sup> and the World Endometriosis Society Montpellier Consortium Consensus <sup>[4]</sup> do not call for routine screening of women with endometriosis for cancer.</p><p>All women should be vigilant of any changes in their bodies, and should seek medical help if they have suggestive symptoms.</p><p><strong>Ovarian cancer</strong> The association with ovarian cancer was the most consistent across studies: out of the 21 studies reviewed, 20 reported an association <span>[5-24]</span>. The available data suggest that the relation is restricted to the endometrioid and clear-cell subtypes of ovarian cancer <sup>[20, 22]</sup> – rare types of ovarian cancer. It must be emphasised that the overall risk is low.</p><p><strong>Breast cancer</strong> Among other gynaecological cancers, 14 studies were reviewed on endometriosis and breast cancer: while six of them reported a modest increase in breast cancer risk in women with endometriosis <sup>[7, 8, 15, 16, 25, 26]</sup>, four others reported no association <span>[24, 27-29]</span>, and four even reported a decreased breast cancer risk associated with endometriosis <sup>[10, 13, 30, 31]</sup>. Overall this is inconclusive, based on current evidence.</p><p><strong>Endometrial and cervical cancer</strong> Results for endometrial cancer were conflicting; however, it is important to note the low numbers of cases in the eight studies reviewed <sup>[7, 8, 10, 15, 16, 24, 32]</sup>. Despite even lower numbers for cervical cancer, however, the four studies that evaluated this association all reported a decreased risk in women with endometriosis <sup>[7, 8, 15, 16]</sup>. It is possible that this is due to women with endometriosis being vigilant about regular examinations by their gynaecologist.</p><p><strong>Melanoma skin cancer</strong> Among non-gynaecological cancers, melanoma skin cancer has been the most studied in relation to a history of endometriosis. Out of the 12 studies that explored this topic, seven suggested a positive association <span>[10, 13, 15, 16, 33-35]</span>, while five studies reported no clear relation between endometriosis and melanoma risk <span>[8, 28, 36-38]</span>, so the evidence is mostly inconclusive.</p><p><strong>Other cancers</strong> Explorations of associations with other cancers have been sparse; consequently, no firm conclusions can be drawn to date as to the subsequent risk of other malignant tumours in women with endometriosis.</p><p><strong>Endometriosis and autoimmune diseases</strong></p><p>An autoimmune disease is a disorder that occurs when the body’s immune system attacks and damages its own tissue. This type of condition may affect one or more organs or tissue types, and it has been shown to more frequently affect women than men <sup>[39]</sup>.</p><p>While endometriosis is not itself an autoimmune disease, our review found nine studies that suggest that women with endometriosis may be at higher risk of several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus <sup>[40, 41]</sup>, Sjögren’s syndrome <sup>[40, 41]</sup>, multiple sclerosis <sup>[40, 41]</sup>, rheumatoid arthritis <sup>[40]</sup>, inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) <sup>[42]</sup>, and coeliac disease <sup>[43]</sup>.</p><p><strong>Endometriosis and asthma and allergic manifestations</strong></p><p>Based on the review of six studies on the topic <span>[40, 44-48]</span>, the available evidence suggests that women with endometriosis may be more susceptible to allergic manifestations (eg. eczema, hay fever, food sensitivities, allergies to medication) and to allergy-related conditions such as asthma.</p><p><strong>Endometriosis and cardiovascular diseases</strong> Among the four studies that investigated a possible relation between endometriosis and cardiovascular diseases, two reported significantly lower flow-mediation dilation (ie. lower ability of the artery to dilate in response to a shear stress) in women with endometriosis as compared with controls <sup>[49, 50]</sup>, while another study found no evidence of a significant difference in carotid intima-media thickness (ie. the thickness of the innermost two layers of the carotid artery’s wall) <sup>[51]</sup>.</p><p>However, the only large-scale epidemiological study on the topic, conducted in the Nurses’ Health Study II cohort, showed increased risks of myocardial infarction, angina, and surgical treatment of the coronary artery in women with endometriosis <sup>[52]</sup>.</p><p><strong>Potential explanations for these associations</strong></p><p>While the exact mechanisms underlying these associations are unknown, the co-occurrence of endometriosis and other disease outcomes may reflect at least four potential explanations:</p><ol><li>Previous studies may have reported spurious associations due to methodological bias. First, the exploration of the subsequent risk of chronic diseases in women with endometriosis carries a number of methodological complexities, which, if not tackled appropriately, may lead to biased conclusions.</li></ol><blockquote><p>For instance, the difficulty to characterise endometriosis and some chronic diseases (e.g. autoimmune diseases) accurately in large-scale population-based studies, or recall bias from women in studies relying on self-reported diagnosis, could lead to systematic errors in the definition of the disease status of study subjects, which in turn may alter the results in an unpredictable direction.</p></blockquote><ol><li>Endometriosis may induce physiological changes that increase the risk of some chronic diseases However, it is possible that some consequences of endometriosis (such as infertility, chronic inflammation, aberrant hormonal and immunologic responses, or lifestyle changes associated with disease diagnosis) influence the long-term risk of other diseases.</li></ol><blockquote><p>For example, chronic inflammation in the pelvic cavity may influence a woman’s risk of ovarian cancer. However, deeper research is needed in order to investigate the physiological pathways that may link endometriosis consequences to chronic disease risk.</p></blockquote><ol><li>Endometriosis may share common risk factors with some chronic diseases. Another possibility is that endometriosis and the studied chronic diseases share common risk factors, whether they are already known or not. All or part of the observed associations could thus simply reflect a correlation of factors.</li></ol><blockquote><p>In this case, this research may allow the discovery of novel risk factors for endometriosis and/or the studied chronic disease. For example, the investigation of an association between endometriosis and melanoma skin cancer helped to discover a novel risk profile for women with endometriosis, who were shown to be more likely to have moles <span>[36, 53-56]</span> and/or a sun-sensitive pigmentary profile (i.e. poor tanning ability <span>[54-56]</span>, red hair <sup>[34, 57, 58]</sup>, fair eyes <sup>[56, 59]</sup>, or freckling <sup>[55, 56]</sup>) than women without endometriosis.</p></blockquote><ol><li>Treatment for endometriosis could be associated with some chronic diseases. Finally, it is also possible that these associations reflect an underlying relation between treatment(s) for endometriosis and the risk of these chronic diseases.</li></ol><blockquote><p>However, little of the research reviewed accounted for this possibility in the analyses.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Endometriosis and potential co-morbidities</strong></p><p>In conclusion, the available data to date suggest that women with endometriosis may represent a high-risk group for a number of chronic diseases.</p><p>However, given the methodological complexities associated with this research and a general lack of detailed data on endometriosis in previous studies, further research is needed in order to increase our understanding of this disease, for which the causes are largely unknown to date.</p><p>If relationships between endometriosis and chronic diseases are confirmed, these findings will have important implications in the management and care of women with endometriosis.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Kvaskoff</strong> M, et al. <strong>Endometriosis: a high-risk population for major chronic diseases?</strong> Hum Reprod Update 2015;21(4):500-516.</li></ol><ul><li><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/endo-co-morbid.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></li></ul><ol><li><p>Garry R.

Vitamin D (vit D), a classic regulator of plasma calcium concentration and skeleton mineralization, is also an effective modulator of the immune system.
