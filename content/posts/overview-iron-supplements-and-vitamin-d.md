#### 1 in 400 people will accumulate Iron

Iron, like Vitamin D is regulated by the body. In the case of Iron, the regulation happens at the input

And, like Vitamin D, a mutated gene will prevent the regulation

In the case of Iron. the global prevalence of the deregulation mutation is about 1 in 400 people 

&nbsp; &nbsp; (vs 1 in 10,000 people for Vitamin D deregulation)

Suspect the Iron deregulation prevalence is higher (say 1 in 2,000) for meat-eating cultures.

Need to investigate excess iron characteristics:

#### Seniors get half as much Iron from plants than younger adults

From Claude-2  Aug 2023

Yes, there is evidence that seniors absorb less iron from plant sources compared to younger adults:

* Age-related changes in stomach acid secretion lead to reduced iron absorption, as stomach acid helps convert plant iron into a form that's more bioavailable.

* A study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that iron absorption from spinach was 54% lower in elderly subjects compared to young adults.

* Another study published in the British Journal of Nutrition showed that iron absorption from wheat, spinach, and lentils was 36-61% lower in the elderly versus young women.

* The phytate content in whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds binds to iron and inhibits absorption. Phytate degradation declines with age, exacerbating the problem.

* Elderly populations have a higher prevalence of atrophic gastritis, which impairs iron absorption, especially from plant sources.

* Inflammation and increased hepcidin levels that occur with aging block iron absorption and transport.

So in summary, yes multiple factors including

* reduced stomach acid, 

* impaired phytate breakdown, 

* inflammation and age-related digestive changes 

result in significantly lower iron bioavailability from plant foods for seniors compared to younger adults. Seniors should be especially mindful of iron intake from plants vs animal foods.

#### [Iron Supplement in WikiPedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_supplement)

Iron can be supplemented by the oral route using various pharmacological forms, such as iron(II) sulfate (this is the most common and cheapest salt, e.g. Feratab, Fer-Iron, Slow-FE,…) and in complex with gluconate, dextran, carbonyl iron, and other salts. Sometimes ascorbic acid is added for better absorption.

 **Heme iron polypeptide (HIP)**  (e.g. Proferrin ES and Proferrin Forte) can be used when regular iron supplements such as ferrous sulfate or ferrous fumarate are not tolerated or absorbed. A clinical study demonstrated that HIP increased serum iron levels  **23 times greater**  than ferrous fumarate on a milligram-per-milligram basis. [Click here for details or studies and purchase](http://www.proferrin.com/clinical-studies/)  also [patented](http://patents.com/us-7585527.html)

Another alternative is ferrous glycine sulfate or ferroglycine sulfate, has less gastrointestinal side-effects than standard preparations such as iron fumarate, It is unusual among oral preparations of iron supplements in that the iron in this preparation has very high oral bio-availability esp in the liquid version (e.g. Hemfer by Alkem). This option should be evaluated before resorting to parenteral therapy. It is especially useful in iron deficiency anemia associated with autoimmune gastritis and Helicobacter pylori gastritis, where it generally has satisfactory effect.

Since iron stores in the body are generally depleted, and there is a limit to what the body can process (about 2–6 mg/kg of body mass per day; i.e. for a 100 kg/220 lb man this is equal to a maximum dose of 200–600 mg/per day) without iron poisoning, this is a chronic therapy which may take 3–6 months.

Due to the frequent intolerance of oral iron and the slow improvement, parenteral iron is recommended in many indications

| Iron Supplement 	 | Tablet Size  | Elemental Iron |
| Ferrous fumarate 	 | 325 mg 	 | 108 mg |
| Ferrous sulfate 	 | 325 mg 	 | 65 mg |
| Ferrous gluconate 	 | 325 mg 	 | 35 mg |

* Adults will usually require a dose of 60-200 mg of elemental iron daily, depending on the severity of the anemia.2 

> Since the amount of iron absorbed decreases as doses get larger, most people should take their daily iron supplement in two or three equally spaced doses.

* Iron supplements are available in regular tablets and capsules, liquid, drops, and coated or extended-release tablets and capsules.

#### Non-daily ferrous sulfate appears to be better than daily - July 2020

 **Comparison of the effects of oral iron treatment every day and every other day in female patients with iron deficiency anaemia** 

https://doi.org/10.1111/imj.14766  $14 paywall

Methods: For a month, 

* Group I received 270 mg ferrous sulphate twice a day (total elemental iron dose: 160 mg/day), 

* Group II received 270 mg ferrous sulphate once a day (total elemental iron dose: 80 mg/day), and 

* Group III received 270 mg ferrous sulphate every other day (total elemental iron dose: 80 mg/every other day).

Intragroup and intergroup statistical analyses were carried out.

Results: Haemoglobin (Hb) increased significantly in all three groups (P = 0.00). The increase in Hb levels was similar among the groups (P = 0.09). Ferritin significantly increased in all three groups after the treatment (P = 0.00). The increase in ferritin in Group I was significantly higher than those in Groups II and III (P < 0.05). Gastrointestinal tract (GIS) side effects were also significantly higher in Group I in comparison to the others (P = 0.001).

Conclusions: A low-dosage of iron treatment every other day may be used in the place of providing iron once or twice every day with similar effectiveness and lower rates of GIS side effects.

#### Suppression of Iron-Regulatory Hepcidin by Vitamin D.

J Am Soc Nephrol. 2013 Nov 7. <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span>

The antibacterial protein hepcidin regulates the absorption, tissue distribution, and extracellular concentration of iron by suppressing ferroportin-mediated export of cellular iron. In CKD, elevated hepcidin and vitamin D deficiency are associated with anemia. Therefore, we explored a  **possible role for vitamin D in iron homeostasis** . Treatment of cultured hepatocytes or monocytes with prohormone 25-hydroxyvitamin D or active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D decreased expression of hepcidin mRNA by 0.5-fold, contrasting the stimulatory effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D on related antibacterial proteins such as cathelicidin. Promoter-reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that direct transcriptional suppression of hepcidin gene (HAMP) expression mediated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D binding to the vitamin D receptor caused the decrease in hepcidin mRNA levels. Suppression of HAMP expression was associated with a concomitant increase in expression of the cellular target for hepcidin, ferroportin protein, and decreased expression of the intracellular iron marker ferritin. In a pilot study with healthy volunteers, supplementation with a  **single oral dose of vitamin D (100,000 IU vitamin D2)**  increased serum levels of 25D-hydroxyvitamin D from 27±2 ng/ml before supplementation to 44±3 ng/ml after supplementation (P<0.001). This response was associated with a  **34% decrease in circulating levels of hepcidin**  within 24 hours of vitamin D supplementation (P<0.05). 

These data show that vitamin D is a potent regulator of the hepcidin-ferroportin axis in humans and highlight a potential new strategy for the management of anemia in patients with low vitamin D and/or CKD.

Hepcidin is a peptide hormone produced by the liver. 

It was discovered in 2000, and appears to be the master regulator of iron homeostasis in humans and other mammals.

Vitamin D regulates the master iron hormone hepcidin, and iron in turn alters vitamin D metabolism. Although vitamin D and iron deficiency are highly prevalent globally, little is known about their interactions in Africa. To evaluate associations between vitamin D and iron status we measured markers of iron status, inflammation, malaria parasitemia, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in 4509 children aged 0.3 months to 8 years living in Kenya, Uganda, Burkina Faso, The Gambia, and South Africa. Prevalence of iron deficiency was 35.1%, and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 0.6% and 7.8% as defined by 25(OH)D concentrations of <30 nmol/L and <50 nmol/L, respectively. Children with 25(OH)D concentrations of <50 nmol/L had a 98% increased risk of iron deficiency (OR 1.98 <span>[95% CI 1.52, 2.58]</span>) compared to those with 25(OH)D concentrations >75 nmol/L. 25(OH)D concentrations variably influenced individual markers of iron status. Inflammation interacted with 25(OH)D concentrations to predict ferritin levels. The link between vitamin D and iron status should be considered in strategies to manage these nutrient deficiencies in African children.
