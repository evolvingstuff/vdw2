OBJECTIVE Interpopulation as well as interindividual variations in response to vitamin D intake commonly observed in subjects with type 2 diabetes may be related to genetic makeup. One of the candidate genes potentially responsible for this diversity is vitamin D receptor (VDR). This study aimed to investigate the interactive effect of VDR Fok-I polymorphism and vitamin D intake on diverse aspects of diabetic host response.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Glycemic status, lipid profiles, inflammatory biomarkers, and VDR Fok-qI genotypes were determined in diabetic subjects (n = 140) who participated in a randomized controlled trial. Participants consumed two 250-mL bottles per day of yogurt drink (doogh) fortified with 500 IU vitamin D/250 mL for 12 weeks.

RESULTS Mean serum 25(OH)D increased by ~30 nmol/L (P < 0.001). 

The time × intervention effect was significant for 

* 25(OH)D (P = 0.030), 

* HDL (P = 0.011), 

* hsCRP (P < 0.001), 

* IL-4 (P = 0.008), and 

* IL-6 (P = 0.017) among the genotypic groups. 

The alleles were defined as ‘‘F’’ or ‘‘f’’ depending on the absence or presence of the restriction site, respectively. 

The least increment in 25(OH)D was in 

* ff (23.0 ± 3.8 nmol/L) compared with 

* Ff (31.2 ± 3.4 nmol/L) and 

* FF (35.6 ± 2.7 nmol/L) (P for trend = 0.009), 

but only the difference between ff and FF was significant (P = 0.023). 

FF group had the largest decrement of both hsCRP and IL-6 compared with Ff (P < 0.001 and P = 0.038) and ff (P = 0.010 and P = 0.048), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS We concluded that those of VDR ff genotype may be regarded as “low responders” to vitamin D intake in terms of response of circulating 25(OH)D and certain inflammatory biomarkers. A nutrigenetic approach may, therefore, be needed to protect diabetic patients from vitamin D deficiency.

## Summary by VitaminDWiki

140 diabetics were given 1000 IU vitamin D (not much) daily in RCT

Those having Fok-I gene  ff  were designated as “low responders”, having just  9.2 ng response

Those having Fok-I gene FF had  14.2 ng response

Average vitamin D 12 ng response
