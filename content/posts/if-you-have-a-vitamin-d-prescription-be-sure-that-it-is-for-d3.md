**Most likely a prescription is for D2, not D3** 

 **Most 50,000 IU prescriptions around the world are still filled with D2** 

 **Some prescriptions specify 50,000 IU of D3, which has been available in the US since about 2000** 

 **[D2 has proven to be not as effective as D3 and actually CAUSE many health problems](/posts/overview-vitamin-d3-not-d2)**

I (founder of VitaminDWiki) have been taking Bio-Tech Pharmacal 50,000 IU D3 for over 5 years now.

I take one every 4 days in winter, every 5 days in the summer

It is available over-the-counter, on the web, and can be prescribed in many countries.

Bio-Tech Pharmacal D3 is ConsumerLab.com Approved for Vitamin D

There are 5+ suppliers for 50,000 IU of D3 - any of which you can get without a prescription

Note: some websites took this information and (mis) stated that you should not take any form of 50,000 IU of vitamin D
