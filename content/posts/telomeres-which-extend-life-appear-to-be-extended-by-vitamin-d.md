Results

Telomere length was shorter with increasing age (P = 0.01). Vitamin D was not associated with telomere length in cross-sectional analysis combining both sexes, but in boys higher vitamin D was related to longer telomeres. An interquartile increase in vitamin D (9.4 ng/mL) was associated with a 2.5% (95% confidence interval: 0.1 to 4.9%; P = 0.04) increase in telomere length. Longitudinal analysis showed similar results for boys (P = 0.02).
