#### <span style="color:#00F;">1) Less sunshine</span>

Air conditioning is more available than in the past

Indoor work

indoors more to stay away from [air pollution](/posts/air-pollution-reduces-vitamin-d-production-many-studies)

Indoors due to fear of [skin cancer](/categories/cancer---skin) with sun exposure

Indoors more to use the internet

#### <span style="color:#00F;">2) Less from Food</span>

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Direct Reasons:</span>** 

4 X less Vitamin D from [farmed fish](/posts/farmed-fish-have-2x-less-omega-3-4x-less-vitamin-d)

3 X less Vitamin D from chickens, pork, etc, raised indoors

2 X less Vitamin D from [low-fat milk](/posts/skim-fat-milk-provides-3-percent-less-vitamin-d) is less bioavailable than whole milk

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Indirect Reasons:</span>** 

More Omega-6 - which blocks Omega-3 needed to get Vitamin D to cells

[Roundup](/posts/investigation-on-roundup-glyphosate-at-vitamindwiki) In food decreases both Vitamin D and [Magnesium](/posts/magnesium-is-needed-by-vitamin-d-in-8-places-2013) (needed to process Vitamin D)

#### <span style="color:#00F;">3) Decrease in nutrients decreases Vitamin D</span>

30% less Vitamin D response in blood if low [Omega-3](/posts/overview-omega-3-many-benefits-include-helping-vitamin-d)  ***** 

20% less Vitamin D getting to cells if low [Magnesium](/posts/magnesium-is-needed-by-vitamin-d-in-8-places-2013)  ***** 

10% less Vitamin D getting to cells if low [Zinc](/posts/zinc-and-vitamin-d)  ***** 

&nbsp; &nbsp;  *****  Estimates are based on multiple studies across a variety of health conditions

#### <span style="color:#00F;">4) Higher % of population with low Vitamin D</span>

#### <span style="color:#00F;">- - Obese, elderly, dark skin, poor health/chronic pain</span>

[Obese need 2X to 3X more vitamin D](/posts/obese-need-2x-to-3x-more-vitamin-d) to get the same response to vitamin D - and more are now obese

Seniors need 3X more vitamin D from the sun to get the same response - and more are now elderly

[Seniors have degraded Vitamin D Receptors](/posts/aging-leads-to-a-decrease-of-vitamin-d-getting-to-cells) - so less vitamin D gets to senior cells

[40% of seniors have liver problems](/posts/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-4-in-10-seniors-and-vitamin-d), which results in lower levels of vitamin D in the blood

[People with dark skins](/posts/overview-dark-skin-and-vitamin-d) need 3X to 5X more vitamin D from the sun than whites - and now only about 50% of US have white skins

Many health problems appear to consume Vitamin D. Examples: [Diabetes](/posts/diabetes-changes-liver-genes-so-as-to-destroy-catabolize-vitamin-d), [Depression](/posts/depression-appears-to-consume-vitamin-d)
