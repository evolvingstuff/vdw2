#### Bird flu has spread to some bears in the US - Jan 2023

 **[Three Montana Grizzly Bears Euthanized Last Fall Tested Positive for Avian Flu](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/us/grizzly-bears-bird-flu.html%20) New York Times[** 

* "The Agriculture Department has recorded avian flu infections in 110 mammals since May 2022, including raccoons, foxes and skunks. "

* "Wild bird populations tend to migrate across hundreds of miles and are often asymptomatic when infected, making it difficult for wildlife experts to track and contain the virus."

#### The next pandemic: H5N1 and H7N9 influenza? March 2021

 **[GAVI.ORG = Vaccine Alliance](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/next-pandemic/h5n1-and-h7n9-influenza)** 

* "Since 1997, the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian subtype has developed the ability to be transmitted from poultry to humans."

* "So far, there are no reports of human-to-human transmission of H5N1, but this is not true of avian influenza subtype H7N9, which emerged in 2013 and has limited suspected cases in which people were infected by family members. "
