I have now used Posit Science for about a decade

Initially ~5 hours a week, recent years ~1/2 hour a week

If I cannot remember where I last left an item in <10 seconds

&nbsp; &nbsp; I remind myself that I need another session with Posit Science.

 **In addition to improving my short-term memory recall it has:** 

1. Increased the speed at which I can listen to videos to 3X of normal speed

1. Greatly increased my biking safety 

   * I can glance behind me and detect cars etc in < 20 milliseconds

1. Greatly increased my driving safety - far more awareness    

   * By the way - I believe that some auto insurance companies give free Posit-Science training

   * The companies have found that senior  claims decreased by 50% after training

## Interview of Dr. Merzenich by Dr. Mercola

##### [How Innate ‘Plasticity’ of Your Brain Allows You to Improve Cognitive Performance and Prevent Age-Related Decline](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/12/09/brain-plasticity.aspx%20) Dec 2012 – has Video with transcript

* After just 40 hours, senior brains work as though they were 14 years younger (age 70 ==> age 56)

* 3 million children used it in public schools.

* Users mix currently: 80% children, 20% adults

* Entire schools have raised their tests results from 10% to 50%

* Just as muscles need exercise, the brain needs exercise

* Practice is needed by professional musician, tennis player a person needs to give their brains practice

* 20 minutes a day. No longer than five or six or seven minutes spent on a specific task, because the benefits weaken if dwell too long

* Need to do a specific task again within a day or so

* They have created 30 cognitive exercises so far, only a few of which are in Brain HQ so far

* Schizophrenics, autistics, and Alz have been helped with Brain HQ – get out of cognitive ruts

* Have helped with cognitive losses following chemotherapy

* Currently PC, MAC, iPad 

> Only in English thus so far:

* Clinical trials underway with the use of the SW with Traumatic Brain Injury, Schizophrenia, and Depression

* [Free trial of Brain HQ](https://brainhq.positscience.com/default/start%20)

> No software to install, but must be connected to the internet to do the exercises

> $10 a month or $99 a year – and just $69/year for additional users

* Henry Lahore has had and is still having, great benefits from ongoing use of Posit Science/Brain HQ
