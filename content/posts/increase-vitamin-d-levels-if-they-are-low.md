#### A Scoping Review of Vitamin D for Nonskeletal Health: A Framework for Evidence-Based Clinical Practice

Clin Ther. 2023 Apr 18;S0149-2918(23)00127-3. [doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2023.03.016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2023.03.016) &nbsp; PDF is behind a paywall

Background: Low serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels are prevalent worldwide. Although the benefits of vitamin D supplementation have focused on skeletal disorders (eg, rickets, osteomalacia, osteoporosis), emerging evidence for nonskeletal health merits further discussion.

Purpose: The purpose of this review was to critically examine the vitamin D supplementation literature pertaining to nonskeletal health to help guide clinicians.

Methods: A scoping review that included observational studies and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) was performed. Evidence from meta-analyses and individual RCTs are discussed, and controversies and future directions are considered.

Findings: 25(OH)D deficiency is a ubiquitous condition associated with multiple nonskeletal diseases, including

* cardiometabolic (heart disease, diabetes, and kidney disease), 

* immune (HIV/AIDS and cancer), 

* lung (from traditional chronic disorders to coronavirus disease 2019), and 

* gut diseases. 

Vitamin D deficiency also affects health across the life span (children, pregnant, and elderly), mental illness, and reproduction in both men and women. 

In contrast, vitamin D supplementation does not necessarily improve major medical outcomes, even when low 25(OH)D levels are treated. Screening for 25(OH)D status remains an important practice, primarily for high-risk patients (eg, elderly, women with osteoporosis, people with low exposure to sunlight). It is reasonable to supplement with vitamin D to treat 25(OH)D deficiency, such that if beneficial nonskeletal health occurs, this may be considered as a coadjutant instead of the central tenet of the disease. Furthermore, optimizing dosing regimens is an important clinical consideration.

Implications: Although 25(OH)D deficiency is prevalent in nonskeletal diseases, there is no uniform evidence that vitamin D supplementation improves major medical outcomes, even when low 25(OH)D levels are corrected. Findings from RCTs warrant caution due to possible selection bias. Overall, vitamin D supplementation must be guided by circulating levels as a reasonable medical practice to correct 25(OH)D deficiency.
