#### [Why Preventing Cancer Is Not the Priority in Drug Development](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/29/upshot/why-preventing-cancer-is-not-the-priority-in-drug-development.html?_r=0)

* “There’s more money to be made investing in drugs that will extend cancer patients’ lives by a few months than in drugs that would prevent cancer in the first place.”

* “Developing drugs to treat late-stage disease is usually much faster than developing drugs to treat early-stage disease or prevention, because late-stage disease is aggressive and progresses rapidly. This allows companies to see results in clinical trials more quickly, even if those results are only small improvements in survival.”

* “Between 1973 and 2011, there were about 12,000 trials for relatively later-stage patients with a 90 percent chance of dying in five years.”

* “but only 500 for cancer prevention, which confer the longest survival gains”

 **Proof of prevention takes a long time** 

Generally the prevention drugs – including vitamin D – would provide little or no profit to big pharma
