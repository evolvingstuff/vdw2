**Bet by  Israeli company:   
By April 1st, <span style="color:#00F;">2022</span>, it will be accepted by health professionals that a vitamin D treatment protocol similar to that used in the study is better than existing treatments (remdesivir and corticosteroids) in reducing the odds of severe outcomes, which we will define as a minimum 1.5x reduction in odds of admission to the ICU.**

 **[Vitamin D Can Likely End the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://blog.rootclaim.com/vitamin-d-can-likely-end-the-covid-19-pandemic/)  Sept 9 - by the company offering the bet** 

"A recent study, the first randomized controlled trial of its kind, showed that high doses of vitamin D (calcifediol) reduce the severity of Covid-19 in hospitalized patients. The researchers reported a 30-fold(!) reduction in intensive care admissions of Covid-19 patients. We at Rootclaim analyzed these findings and concluded that even under conservative assumptions accounting for limitations in the study, the effect is still significant and likely around  **<span style="color:#F00;">5-fold</span>** . We further demonstrated that since the risks of treatment are low, this treatment protocol should be immediately implemented."
