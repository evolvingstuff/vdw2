#### Oral microbiota and vitamin D impact on oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinogenesis: a narrative literature review - Jan 2021

Crit Rev Microbiol . 2021 Jan 21;1-24. [doi: 10.1080/1040841X.2021.1872487](https://doi.org/10.1080/1040841X.2021.1872487)

An emerging body of research is revealing the microbiota pivotal involvement in determining the health or disease state of several human niches, and that of vitamin D also in extra-skeletal regions. Nevertheless, much of the oral microbiota and vitamin D reciprocal impact in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinogenesis (OPSCC) is still mostly unknown. On this premise, starting from an in-depth scientific bibliographic analysis, this narrative literature review aims to show a detailed view of the state of the art on their contribution in the pathogenesis of this cancer type. Significant differences in the oral microbiota species quantity and quality have been detected in OPSCC-affected patients; in particular, mainly high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs), Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida spp. seem to be highly represented. Vitamin D prevents and fights infections promoted by the above identified pathogens, thus confirming its homeostatic function on the microbiota balance. However, its antimicrobial and antitumoral actions, well-described for the gut, have not been fully documented for the oropharynx yet. Deeper investigations of the mechanisms that link vitamin D levels, oral microbial diversity and inflammatory processes will lead to a better definition of OPSCC risk factors for the optimization of specific prevention and treatment strategies.

#### Impact of dietary vitamin D on initiation and progression of oral cancer - May 2020

J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol . 2020 May;199:105603. [doi: 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2020.105603.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2020.105603.) Epub 2020 Jan 22.

Calcitriol, the active metabolite of vitamin D, has been widely studied for its preventive and therapeutic activity against several cancers including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, the impact of dietary vitamin D supplementation on initiation and progression of OSCC is unclear. To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted preclinical trials using the 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide 4NQO carcinogen model of oral carcinogenesis. Female C57BL/6 mice were maintained on one of three vitamin D diets <span>[25 IU, 100 IU, 10,000 IU]</span> and exposed to 4NQO in drinking water for 16 weeks followed by regular water for 10 weeks. Body weight measurements obtained through the study duration did not reveal any differences between the three diets. Animals on 100 IU diet showed lower incidence of high-grade dysplasia/OSCC and higher CD3 + T cells compared to animals on 25 IU and 10,000 IU diets. 

Serum 25OHD3 levels were highest in animals on 10,000 IU diet at week 0 prior to carcinogen exposure but showed ∼50 % reduction at week 26. Histologic evaluation revealed highest incidence of OSCC in animals maintained on 10,000 IU diet. Animals on 100 IU and 10,000 IU diets showed higher vitamin D receptor VDR and CYP24A1 immunostaining in high-grade dysplastic lesions and OSCC compared to normal tongue. Validation studies performed in a 4NQO-derived OSCC model showed that short-term treatment of animals on a 25 IU diet with calcitriol significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to controls but did not affect tumor growth in animals on reference diet 1000 IU. Collectively, our results highlight the complex dynamics between vitamin D status and oral carcinogenesis. Our observations also suggest that therapeutic benefits of short-term calcitriol treatment may be more pronounced in vitamin D deficient hosts.

 **Highlights** 

* This review paper focuses on the role of vitamin D and VDR on oral cancer.

* Oral cancer chemoresistance and its relation with VDR are discussed.

* Mechanisms of anticancer effects of calcitriol are reviewed.

* Polymorphisms in VDR gene, cancer risk and prognosis in oral cancer are mentioned.

Oral cancer is known as one of the most common cancers, with a poor prognosis, related to delayed clinical diagnosis, either due to the lack of particular biomarkers related to the disease or costly therapeutic alternatives. Vitamin D executes its functions by interacting with the vitamin D receptor (VDR), both in healthy and diseased individuals, including oral cancer. This review discusses the role of vitamin D and VDR on tumorigenesis, emphasizing on oral cancer. Furthermore, regulation of VDR expression, mechanisms of anticancer effects of calcitriol, oral cancer chemoresistance and its relation with VDR and polymorphisms of VDR gene will be discussed. The manuscript is prepared mainly using the information collected from PubMed and MEDLINE.

Objectives

Serum level of vitamin D has been used as a predictor for cancer development. We intend to measure the baseline vitamin D level in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and to compare same with non‐cancer controls to determine any association.

Materials and methods

Patients with OSCC presenting to our clinics were included in this study. Their baseline serum vitamin D levels were measured prior to cancer treatment after obtaining their consents. These patients were then matched with at least 2 cancer‐free subjects to serve as controls and whose serum vitamin D levels were also measured. The serum vitamin D levels obtained for the two groups were then categorized into normal (>35 ng/ml), mild deficiency (25–35 ng/ml), moderate deficiency (12.5–25 ng/ml), and severe deficiency (<12.5 ng/ml). The data were analyzed statistically and the two groups compared.

Results

A total of 51 patients with OSCC (Male 22 <span>[43%]</span> and female 29 <span>[57%]</span>) and 113 cancer‐free controls (Male 36 <span>[31.86%]</span> and female 77 <span>[68.14%]</span>) were included in the study. The commonest site for OSCC was the tongue, accounting for 45% of the cancer cases. Mean age for cancer patients was 59.33 years ±12.54 and 49.24 years ±15.79 for the control. Among the OSCC patients, 74.51% had moderate to severe vitamin D deficiencies, whereas only 20.35% had a moderate deficiency in the control group with no severe deficiency.

Conclusion

Logistic regression analysis shows a positive association between vitamin D deficiency and OSCC risk especially in levels below 25 ng/ml. This further corroborates the assertion that vitamin D deficiency may be a useful indicator of OSCC. It may, therefore, be necessary to routinely prescribe vitamin D supplements to subjects with moderate to severe deficiencies in order to decrease the chances of OSCC development.
