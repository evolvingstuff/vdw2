* "In one 2019 study, one in four people with diabetes reported using less insulin than they needed because of the cost. "

* "For the insulin I use, Eli Lilly’s Humalog, the list price is $332 per vial, which is what I would pay if I wasn’t insured. I usually use two or three vials per month. Other people with diabetes might require substantially more. It adds up fast. When Humalog came out in 1996, one vial cost $21."

* "n 2016, the average annual cost of insulin for a person with Type 1 diabetes in the U.S. was $5,705, more than double what it was in 2012. In general, people with diabetes spend on average 2.3 times more on health care than people without diabetes."
