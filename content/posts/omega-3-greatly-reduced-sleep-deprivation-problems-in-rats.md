Then Fear Conditioning

Then Deprived rats of REM sleep

Then tested Performance

 **Highlights** 

•Omega-3 showed dual effect on context- or auditory-dependent fear memory.

•Intravenously administration of omega-3 induced anxiolytic-like behaviors.

•Depression-like behaviors decreased by injection of omega-3.

•Administration of omega-3 produced anti-nociceptive responses.

•Omega-3 plays main role in cognitive deficiencies induced by RSD.

Prolonged sleep deprivation causes cognitive deficits.  **In rats, for instance, sleep deprivation weakens spatial learning and long-term potentiation (LTP).**  We examined the effects of omega-3 on cognitive deficiency induced by REM sleep deprivation (RSD). For this purpose, we used a fear conditioning paradigm, forced swim test (FST) apparatus, and hot plate test. Intravenously omega-3 injection was performed during 3 consecutive days. Rats trained in the fear conditioning apparatus after 24 hours. During conditioning, animals were received foot shocks, either alone or paired with a sound. Sleep deprivation paradigm was carried out in which REM sleep was completely prevented and non-REM sleep was intensely declined for 24 hours. Then, context-dependent retention, anxiety behaviors, and hot plate tests were done. Auditory-dependent retention, anxiety behaviors, and FST were carried out 24 hours later. 24 hours of RSD impaired cognitive function, however intravenously administration of omega-3 improved (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg) context- or auditory-dependent memory, induced anxiolytic (1 mg/kg), antidepressant (1.25 mg/kg), and anti-nociceptive (0.25 mg/kg) effects. The results revealed that RSD interferes with the neural systems underlying cognitive functions and supports the involvement of omega-3 in the modulation of cognitive functions.
