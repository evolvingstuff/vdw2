Expect similar results of spread if spread over 1 week

Expect much better results with same dose if use Vitamin  **D3**

BACKGROUND:

Fatigue is a common presenting complaint of patients in the primary care offices. Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with fatigue in cancer patients. Normalization of vitamin D level improves their fatigue. Whether low vitamin D plays a role in fatigue in medically stable patients is not known.

AIMS:

This prospective non-randomized therapeutic study observed the prevalence of low vitamin D in fatigue and the effect of normalization of vitamin D on fatigue.

MATERIAL AND METHODS:

One hundred and seventy four adult patients, who presented in our primary care office with fatigue and stable chronic medical conditions,completed fatigue assessment questionnaires. Patients with low vitamin D levels received ergocalciferol therapy for 5 weeks. Scores of pre- and post-treatment fatigue assessment questionnaires were compared.

RESULTS:

Prevalence of low vitamin D was 77.2% in patients who presented with fatigue. After normalization of vitamin D levels fatigue symptom scores improved significantly (P < 0.001) in all five subscale categories of fatigue assessment questionnaires.

CONCLUSION:

The prevalence of low vitamin D is high in patients who present with fatigue and stable chronic medical conditions, if any. Normalization of vitamin D levels with ergocalciferol therapy significantly improves the severity of their fatigue symptoms.
