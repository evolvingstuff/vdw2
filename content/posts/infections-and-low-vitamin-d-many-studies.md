Deep neck infection (DNI) refers to infections in spaces created by superficial and deep cervical fascia around the muscles and organs in the neck. Vitamin D is highly important for an effective immune system. Vitamin D receptors (VDR) have been identified in immune system cells, and particularly in T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Vitamin D deficiency is thought to result in impaired immune response, decreased leukocyte chemotaxis, and an increased disposition to infection. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether vitamin D deficiency is an underlying occult factor in the development of DNI. Sixty-five patients aged 6 to 90, diagnosed with DNI, and 70 healthy age- and sex-compatible cases were included in the study. Serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) were determined in each case. 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels above 20 ng/mL were regarded as normal, 12 to 20 ng/mL as insufficient, 5 to 12 ng/mL as deficient, and less than 5 ng/mL as severely deficient. 

Mean serum 25(OH)D levels were 

* 10.4 (6.2) ng/mL in the patient group and 

* 15.5 (6.4) ng/mL in the control group (P < .01). 

This difference was statistically significant (P < .01). Vitamin D was within normal limits in 9.2% (n = 6) of cases in the study group, insufficient in 29.2% (n = 19), deficient in 35.3% (n = 23), and severely deficient in 26.2% (n = 17). The equivalent values in the control group were 21.4% (n = 15), 48.5% (n = 34), 30% (n = 21), and 0% (n = 0). Serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in patients with DNI compared to the healthy cases; 25(OH)D levels may be a factor in the development of DNI.

#### Deep neck infections: A single-center analysis of 63 cases - Sept 2017

Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal. 2017 Sep; 22(5): e536–e541, online 2017 Aug 16. [doi: 10.4317/medoral.21799](https://doi.org/10.4317/medoral.21799)

Background and Purpose

With the use of antibiotic therapy, the incidence of deep neck infections has decreased in recent decades. The aim of this investigation was to review the clinical course and the management of deep neck infections in our department, compare them to the experiences of the common literature and identify predisposing factors for lethal complications.

Material and Methods

In this single-center analysis, 63 patients with deep neck infections were treated surgically. The following clinical data were analyzed and compared: age, gender, laboratory data, spatial manifestation, therapeutic modalities, comorbidities, length of hospitalization and complications.

Results

There was a predominance of male patients (58.7%) and a mean age of 57.9 years. The most common symptoms at diagnosis were sore throat (96.8%) and neck swelling (92.0%). Cardio/pulmonary diseases and diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbidities. There was a significantly longer hospital stay for patients with diabetes mellitus. The most common manifestation was a parapharyngeal abscess in 24 patients (38.1%), followed by peri-/retrotonsillar infections in 19 patients (30.2%). In 29 patients, a multiple space infection was observed, with a significantly longer duration of hospitalization and a higher rate of complications. The main life-threatening complication was the development of airway obstruction in 20 patients (31.7%), who all received a tracheostomy. The duration of hospitalization for patients with complications was significantly longer.

Conclusions

Close attention must be paid to the management of patients with deep neck infections, especially patients with diabetes mellitus and cardio/pulmonary diseases or patients with multiple space infections.
