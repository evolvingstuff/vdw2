**Note: For many years there has been an attempt at standardizing Vitamin D measurments used for research  
It appears that most hospitals/testing facilities are not "standardized"**

Background: To compare four automated immunoassays for the measurement of 25(OH)-vitamin D (25-OHD) and to assess the impact on the results obtained from a healthy population.

Methods: We analysed 100 serum samples on Unicel DxI 800 (Beckman Coulter), Architect i1000 (Abbott), Cobas e411 (Roche) and Liaison XL (DiaSorin). Passing-Bablok regression and Bland-Altman plots were used for method comparison. In order to categorise the obtained values, results were categorised into the following groups: 0-25 nmol/L, 25-50 nmol/L, 50-75 nmol/L and above 75 nmol/L and compared. The percentage of samples below 75 nmol/L, and below 50 nmol/L was then calculated for every method.

Results: According to paired comparisons, each method differs from others (p<0.0001) except Cobas vs Architect, which do not show a statistically significant difference (p=0.39). The strongest correlation was found between Liaison and Architect (ρ=0.94, p<0.0001). 

The percentage of samples below the recommended value of **75 nmol/L**  were:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 70%  | Architect |
| 92%  | Liaison |
| 71% | Cobas |
| 89%  | Unicel |

 

The percentage of samples below the value of  **50 nmol/L**  were:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 17%  | (Architect) |
| 55% | (Liaison),  |
| 28% | (Cobas) |
| 47%  | (Unicel). |

Conclusions: The observed differences stem from the use of different analytical systems for 25-OHD concentration analysis and can result in different outcomes. The recommended values should be established for each assay in accorda
