#### IBS helped in many ways by Vitamin D (better if had used gut-friendly forms) – meta-analysis Jan 2025

 **Impact of vitamin D supplementation on symptom severity and quality of life in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A meta-analysis** 

Shuang Qi 1, Meng Zhao 2, Yinuo Sun 2, Sunaina Boro 3, Bhawna Arora 4, Sanjay Rastogi 5

Adv Clin Exp Med. 2025 Jan 24. [doi: 10.17219/acem/191463](https://doi.org/10.17219/acem/191463) 

Background: Vitamin D supplementation could offer irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients significant improvements in terms of symptom severity and overall quality of life (QoL). Yet, the potential benefits and risks associated with vitamin D supplementation still require additional investigation.

Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on IBS using a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Material and methods: A comprehensive search was carried out utilizing 4 electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) to identify articles published in English-language peer-reviewed journals. The odds ratios (ORs), risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs), along with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), were computed. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the appropriate p-value and Cochrane Q and I2 statistics. For the analysis, RevMan 5.3 was utilized.

Results: Nine randomized controlled trials involving a total of 780 participants were included in this study. Vitamin D supplementation, in adolescents and young adults with IBS, improves the IBS symptoms severity score, QoL and serum 25(OH)D levels compared to controls. 

We obtained an 

* OR of 2.34 (95% CI: 1.56-3.50) for change in the IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), 

* OR = 2.51 (95% CI: 1.71-3.70) for change in QoL, 

* low risk of any adverse events (RR 0.49 (95% CI: 0.35-0.69)), and 

* substantial changes in serum 25(OH)D level (MD = 11.29 (95% CI: 7.13-15.45)).

Results were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: Vitamin D supplementation could lead to better IBS management with a low risk of adverse events.

#### Role of in vitamin D in irritable bowel syndrome - April 2023

World J Clin Cases. 2023 Apr 26; 11(12): 2677–2683. [doi: 10.12998/wjcc.v11.i12.2677](https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v11.i12.2677)

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder affecting 10%-22% of adults. Its development is closely related to the gut microbiota, and the inflammatory and immune responses triggered by the gut microbiota can lead to IBS. Vitamin D (VD) effectively treats IBS with fewer side effects by improving gut microbiota, immune regulation, and anti-inflammatory effects. In the future, it is necessary to carry out epidemiological studies on the relationship between VD and IBS, clinical studies on the efficacy of supplementing VD to improve IBS, and animal studies on the mechanism of VD improving IBS. Therefore, this paper discussed the relationship between VD and IBS.

#### IBS quality of life improved somewhat when add some standard vitamin D for a short time - meta-analysis Sept 2024

 **The effects of vitamin D intake and status on symptom severity and quality-of-life in adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): a systematic review and meta-analysis** 

Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr 2024 Sep 5:1-14. [doi: 10.1080/10408398.2024.2400603](https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2024.2400603)

 **Vitamin D levels did not increase much (small dose, short time, not a gut-friendly form of vitamin D)**

Importance: Many individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have insufficient or deficient serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> status; however, it is not clear if improved vitamin D nutritional status through higher intake can improve symptom severity and quality of life.

Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify if changes in vitamin D intake or status affect symptom severity and quality of life in adults with IBS.Data Sources: MEDLINE®, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Global Health, EMBASE, and Web-of-Science databases were systematically searched for relevant articles to August 12, 2024, in the English language.Study Selection: Clinical trials, prospective observational studies, and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses reporting the effect of vitamin D intake or status on IBS-related outcomes were included.Data Extraction and Synthesis: Article review and data extraction were conducted by 2 authors following the PRISMA guidelines. Random effects meta-analyses and the Nutrition Quality Evaluation Strengthening Tools to assess risk of bias were employed for randomized controlled trials.Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Primary outcomes included measures of serum 25(OH)D status, symptom severity, and quality of life.

Results: 12 studies from 15 articles were included (n = 7 RCTs; n = 3 single-arm interventions; n = 2 MR). Seven study populations had deficient (<20 ng/mL) and three had insufficient (21-29 ng/mL) baseline serum 25(OH)D status. RCTs measured changes in serum 25(OH)D after **6-26 wks with 3,000 IU daily to 50,000 IU bi-weekly**  vitamin D dosages. Meta-analyses of low risk-of-bias RCTs revealed increased 25(OH)D levels in groups treated with oral vitamin D compared to placebo (n = 5; Pooled mean difference <span>[95% CI]</span>: 20.33 <span>[1[2.91, 27.74]</span> ng/mL; I2 = 97.9%). Quality of life scores improved significantly in deficient populations (n = 3;  **3.19**  <span>[2.14, 4.24]</span>; I2 = 0.0%). 

Non-significant decreased trends in IBS symptom severity were shown across populations (n = 6: -25.89 <span>[-55.26, 3.48]</span>; I2 = 92.8%).

Conclusion: Moderate level evidence indicate vitamin D supplementation may improve status in adults with IBS and quality of life in those with deficient status at baseline.

#### Asked Chat-GPT to compare IBS with IBD

Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( **IBS** ) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( **IBD** ) are both chronic conditions that affect the digestive system, but they are distinct in their underlying causes, symptoms, and treatments. Here’s a comparison:

Nature of the Condition:

 **IBS** : It is a functional disorder, which means the symptoms are not associated with any visible signs of damage or disease in the digestive tract. It affects how the bowel functions.

 **IBD** : It is an autoimmune disease that involves chronic inflammation of the digestive tract. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is visible inflammation and damage to the digestive tract.

Common Forms:

 **IBS** : It doesn't have different forms but can be classified based on the predominant symptom 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ( **IBS-D**  for diarrhea predominant,  **IBS-C**  for constipation predominant,  **IBS-M**  for mixed).

 **IBD** : Common forms are  **Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis** .

Symptoms:

 **IBS** : Abdominal pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation, mucus in the stool. The pain is often relieved by a bowel movement.

 **IBD** : Abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, reduced appetite, blood in the stool, joint pain, and fevers.

Cause:

 **IBS** : The exact cause is not known but it is thought to be related to a combination of abnormal gastrointestinal tract movements, increased sensitivity to pain, and possibly an imbalance of gut bacteria.

 **IBD** : It is believed to be caused by an abnormal immune response, where the immune system attacks the cells of the digestive tract. Genetics, environmental factors, and an imbalance of gut bacteria are also thought to play a role.

Diagnosis:

 **IBS** : Usually diagnosed based on symptoms and exclusion of other diseases. There are no specific laboratory tests to diagnose  **IBS** .

 **IBD** : Can be diagnosed through blood tests, stool tests, endoscopy, and imaging studies which show inflammation and damage in the digestive tract.

Treatment:

 **IBS** : Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms. This may include changes in diet, medications to treat diarrhea or constipation, and stress reduction.

 **IBD** : Treatment aims to reduce inflammation. This often involves medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs, immune system suppressors, and sometimes surgery to remove damaged portions of the digestive tract.

Complications:

 **IBS** : It generally doesn’t cause complications but can significantly impact quality of life.

 **IBD** : Can lead to serious complications such as strictures, abscesses, malnutrition, and increased risk of colon cancer.

Prevalence:

 **IBS** : Is more common compared to  **IBD** .

 **IBD** : Less common but tends to be more severe.

It's important to note that although they have similarities in symptoms,  **IBS**  and  **IBD**  are fundamentally different. Proper diagnosis and management are crucial for both conditions. Always consult a healthcare provider for advice and information regarding diagnosis and treatment.
