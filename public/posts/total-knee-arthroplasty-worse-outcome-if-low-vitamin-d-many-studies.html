The purpose of this prospective observational study was to report on the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in patients scheduled for elective primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and its associated risk factors.</p><p>Methods: In this monocentric cohort study, 25(OH) vitamin D serum levels were measured in 687 consecutive patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) over a period of twelve months. Vitamin D levels were classified into deficiency (&lt;20 ng/mL), insufficiency (20–29 ng/mL), and sufficiency (≥30 ng/mL). The study assessed the association of vitamin D levels with demographic and clinical factors, including age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and season of measurement. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests, correlation analyses, and multiple linear regression to identify significant predictors of vitamin D levels.</p><p>Results: The cohort had a mean age of 67.70 ± 8.95 years and a mean BMI of 31.00 ± 5.71 kg/m2. Collectively, 33.9% of patients were vitamin D deficient, a further 32.9% were insufficient, and only 33.2% were sufficient. Vitamin D levels varied significantly with the season and were associated with obesity and smoking. Specifically, there was a small significant inverse correlation between BMI and vitamin D levels (r = −0.17, p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, regular nicotine abuse was linked to lower vitamin D levels (r = 0.14, p &lt; 0.01). Multiple linear regression analysis reveals that age, BMI, nicotine abuse, and season were small significant predictors of preoperative vitamin D levels (R2 = 0.15, adjusted R2 = 0.12). A total of 121 (17.61%) patients reported routine vitamin D intake prior to surgery. Supplementing patients had a significantly higher mean serum vitamin D level and a significant reduction in the mean length of in-hospital stay (p &lt; 0.01).</p><p>Conclusions: The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in patients undergoing elective primary TKA is alarmingly high. In ongoing efforts to optimize the efficacy and outcome of the TKA procedure, orthopedic surgeons should be advised to strongly implement the role of perioperative vitamin D levels in their routine practice.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/tka-d-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=tka-with-enough-vitamin-d-12-day-shorter-hospital-time-quicker-recovery---meta-analysis-april-2024>TKA with enough Vitamin D: 1/2 day shorter hospital time, quicker recovery - meta-analysis April 2024</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D Deficiency Leads to Poorer Health Outcomes and Greater Length of Stay After Total Knee Arthroplasty and Supplementation Improves Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</strong></p><p>JBJS Rev. 2024 Apr 4;12(4). <a href=https://doi.org/10.2106/JBJS.RVW.23.00150>doi: 10.2106/JBJS.RVW.23.00150</a></p><p>Kavyesh Vivek 1, Rayan Kamal 1, Edward Perera 2, Chinmay M Gupte 1 2</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/tka-10-summaries.png alt=image width=700><p>Background: Vitamin D deficiency is increasingly identified as a predictor of poorer outcomes in musculoskeletal disease affecting as many as 1 in 4 people. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on outcomes after primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).</p><p>Methods: A targeted search of terms related to vitamin D and TKA outcomes was performed in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, and British Orthopaedic Association databases. The results were analyzed using forest plots with I2 heterogeneity statistics and pooled effects with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p values. A p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p>Results: A total of 146,054 patients with 150,107 TKRs were analyzed in 10 studies that complied with the inclusion criteria, of which 3 were suitable for meta-analysis. Of these, 4 of the 10 studies showed that vitamin D deficiency resulted in poorer functional outcome scores (Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Knee Society Scoring System, and American Knee Society scores), as well as increased risk of revision surgery, incidence of joint infection, and postoperative stiffness. Meta-analysis of length of hospital stay (LOS) demonstrated a significant increase in LOS in patients with vitamin D deficiency (standardized mean difference, -0.54, 95% CI, -0.69 to -0.38, p &lt; 0.00001). Furthermore, outcomes were improved with vitamin D supplementation in 6 of 10 studies.</p><p>Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency results in poorer outcomes of primary TKA, with improved outcomes after supplementation. Further studies should examine the role of preoperative vitamin D screening and/or perioperative supplementation in primary TKA and standardize outcome measures to assess their effect.</p><p>Level of evidence: Level I/II.

Patients were divided into two groups according to their vitamin D levels as assessed at the preoperative visit: (1) vitamin D-deficient group, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D) levels &lt;12 ng/mL; (2) vitamin D non-deficient group, serum 25(OH)D levels ≥12 ng/mL. American Knee Society Score (KSS) and four other performance tests including the alternative step test (AST), six-metre walk test (SMT), sit-to-stand test (STS), and timed up and go test (TUGT) were used for assessment of post-operative function. All assessments were performed one day before and three months after TKA.</p><p>Results</p><p>Of the 92 patients included in the study, 87 patients performed all required assessments. The mean post-operative functional KSS was significantly lesser in the vitamin D-deficient group than in the vitamin D non-deficient group (67.2 vs. 73.4, p = 0.031). The mean values of time taken for post-operative AST (16.6 vs. 14.6 s, p = 0.033) and SMT (8.8 vs. 7.7 s, p = 0.012) were significantly longer in the vitamin D-deficient group than in the vitamin D non-deficient group. Post-operative STS and TUGT demonstrated higher values for mean time taken in the vitamin D-deficient group than in the vitamin D non-deficient group, but these were not statistically significant (13.6 vs. 12.4 s, not significant (n.s.); 12.7 vs. 11.7 s, n.s., respectively).</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Early post-operative functional outcomes following TKA appear to be adversely affected by vitamin D deficiency.</p><p>Level of evidence: Prospective cohort study, Level II.</p><p><strong><a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00167-016-4209-8>Publisher wants $40 for the PDF</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=better-knee-osteoarthritis--outcomes-if-has-higher-vitamin-d-levels---may-2017>Better Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes if has higher vitamin D levels - May 2017</h4><p><strong>Maintaining Vitamin D Sufficiency Is Associated with Improved Structural and Symptomatic Outcomes in Knee Osteoarthritis</strong></p><p>The American Journal of Medicine, online 24 May 2017, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2017.04.038>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2017.04.038</a></p><p>Background</p><p>The aim of this study was to describe whether maintaining sufficient serum vitamin D levels in people with knee osteoarthritis and baseline vitamin D insufficiency has an association with change in knee structures and symptoms over 2 years.</p><p>Methods</p><p>Participants (n = 413, mean age 63.2 years) with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis and vitamin D insufficiency were enrolled in a clinical trial.

Knee symptoms were assessed at baseline and months 3, 6, 12, and 24 using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index.</p><p>Results</p><p>The consistently sufficient group had significantly less loss of tibial cartilage volume (β 2.1%; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>, 0.3%, 3.9%), less increase in effusion-synovitis volume (β −2.5 mL; 95 CI%, −4.7, −0.2 mL), and less loss of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index physical function (β −94.2; 95% CI, −183.8, −4.5) compared with the consistently insufficient group in multivariable analyses. In contrast, there were no significant differences in these outcomes between the fluctuating and consistently insufficient groups. Changes in cartilage defects, bone marrow lesions, and knee pain were similar between groups.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>This post hoc analysis suggests beneficial effects of maintaining vitamin D sufficiency on cartilage loss, effusion-synovitis, and physical function in people with knee osteoarthritis.</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934317305065?_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_docanchor=&amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb">Publisher wants $36 for the PDF</a></strong></p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>blood levels</span>
