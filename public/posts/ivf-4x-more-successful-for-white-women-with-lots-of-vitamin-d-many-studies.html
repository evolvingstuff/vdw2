relevance in the context of couples utilizing assisted reproductive technologies is of particular interest.</p><p>Methods</p><p>This study aimed to assess the levels of 25(OH)D by ELISA in the biological fluids (serum, semen, and follicular fluid) of 105 couples undergoing in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Additionally, the association among 3 vitamin D receptor polymorphisms (Apa1, Fok1, and Taq1) and vitamin D status, as well as the clinical pregnancy rate after in vitro fertilization, were investigated.</p><p>Results</p><p>The results revealed a high rate of hypovitaminosis in the women’s group. Furthermore, a significant difference was observed in the fertilization rate (P = 0.007). Correlations were found between Apa1 polymorphism and the number of collected oocytes (P = 0.014), the number of embryos (P = 0.001), the number of 2 pronuclear (P = 0.001), and the frequency of clinical pregnancies (P = 0.046). Additionally, correlations were found between Taq1 SNP and the number of embryos (P = 0.046) and the serum vitamin D level (P = 0.042). The Fok1 polymorphism showed correlations with semen concentration (P = 0.044) and clinical outcome (P = 0.032).</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>These results suggest the importance of systemic vitamin D for women prior to pregnancy. The findings emphasize the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in women before pregnancy and call for cautious interpretation of data regarding the impact of vitamin D on pregnancy.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/genes-and-assisted-reproductive-technologies-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=ivf-perhaps-2x-average-more-successful-if-36-ng-of-vitamin-d---may-2024>IVF perhaps 2X average more successful if 36 ng of Vitamin D - May 2024</h4><p><strong>Association Between Vitamin D Level and Clinical Outcomes of Assisted Reproductive Treatment: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis</strong></p><p>Reproductive Endocrinology: Review</p><p>Chenhao Xu, Xinqi An, Xiumei Tang, Yunxiao Yang, Qi Deng, Quanling Kong, Ying Hu & Dongzhi Yuan</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/cpr.webp alt=image width=600><p>The investigation about association between vitamin D level and clinical outcomes of assisted reproductive treatment showed various outcomes. This study aimed to review the correlation between vitamin D and outcomes of assisted reproductive treatment. The search was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42023458040). PubMed, Embase, Medline, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane databases were searched up to July 2023. Twenty-three observational studies were selected for meta-analysis. Comparing groups with deficient and ‘insufficient + sufficient’ vitamin D level, meta-analysis showed positive correlation between clinical pregnancy rate and vitamin D (OR 0.81, 95%CI: 0.70, 0.95, P = 0.0001). Comparing groups with ‘deficient + insufficient’ and sufficient vitamin D level, meta-analysis showed positive correlation between vitamin D and clinical pregnancy rate (OR 0.71, 95%CI: 0.55, 0.91, P = 0.006), vitamin D and live birth rate (OR 0.69, 95%CI: 0.54, 0.89, P = 0.003). Subgroup analysis did not show the source of high heterogeneity. No correlation was found in biochemical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and implantation rate. In dose-response meta-analysis, a nonlinear association was found between vitamin D levels and outcomes when levels are below approximately 24 ng/L. The study shows that vitamin D level is associated with clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate. Low vitamin D level does not influence biochemical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and implantation rate. Furthermore, 24 ng/L may be a possible threshold of vitamin D concentration in assisted reproduction therapy.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/assisted-reproductive-treatment-meta-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=43-of-us-insurances-do-not-pay-for-any-part-of-ivf---sept-2023>43% of US insurances do not pay for any part of IVF - Sept 2023</h4><p><strong><a href="https://www.mercer.com/en-us/insights/us-health-news/the-next-wave-in-inclusive-family-planning-support/#:~:text=in%202022%2C%2043%25%20of%20large%20employers%20covered%20ivf">Mercer.com</a></strong></p><ul><li>&ldquo;Their data suggest that approximately 38% of patients who freeze eggs return to use them two to five years later.&rdquo;</li></ul><p><strong>VitaminDWiki suspects more IVF success if supplement both the man and the woman with Vitamin D months before the egg is made and, perhaps years later, for the mother months before the egg is transplanted</strong></p><hr><h4 id=ivf-women-with-good-vitamin-d-were-17-x-more-likely-to-have-a-live-birth---meta-analysis-aug-2020>IVF women with good vitamin D were 1.7 X more likely to have a live birth - meta-analysis Aug 2020</h4><p><strong>Women’s vitamin D levels and IVF results: a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis, considering three categories of vitamin status (replete, insufficient and deficient)</strong></p><p>Human Fertility <a href=https://doi.org/10.1080/14647273.2020.1807618>https://doi.org/10.1080/14647273.2020.1807618</a></p><p>Florina Iliuta,Jose Ignacio Pijoan,Lucía Lainz,Antonia Exposito &amp;Roberto Matorras</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/increased-ivf-if-sufficient.jpg alt=image width=500><p>To investigate the influence of vitamin D status on in vitro fertilisation (IVF) results, a meta-analysis of 15 cohort studies of 3711 women undergoing IVF was performed. Women were classified into three groups according their vitamin D levels (≥30 ng/mL considered replete/sufficient; 21–29 ng/mL insufficient and &lt;20 ng/mL deficient). Three different meta-analyses were performed: (i) sufficient vs deficient; (ii) sufficient vs ‘insufficient + deficient’; (iii) ‘sufficient + insufficient’ vs deficient. Comparing IVF outcomes in sufficient versus deficient groups (considering autologous and donor oocyte cycles together), we found women with</p><p>sufficient vitamin D had significantly higher</p><ul><li><p>biochemical pregnancy (OR = 1.43 <span>[1.06–1.95]</span>),</p></li><li><p>ongoing pregnancy (OR = 1.29 <span>[1.02–1.64]</span>), and</p></li><li><p>live birth (OR = 1.74 <span>[1.31–2.31]</span>) rates,</p></li></ul><p>with a non-significant trend to a higher clinical pregnancy rate (OR = 1.31 <span>[0.94–1.82]</span>), whereas implantation and miscarriage rates were similar. When the meta-analysis was restricted to autologous oocytes, the parameters which had been significant in the joint analysis remained significant, and differences in implantation (OR = 1.64, <span>[1.17–2.29]</span>) and clinical pregnancy (OR = 1.47 <span>[1.2–1.69]</span>) rates became significant. No significant differences were found when considering only cycles with donor oocytes. The sufficient + insufficient vs deficient and sufficient vs ‘insufficient + deficient’ comparisons identified significant differences in live birth rate. The meta-analysis shows that sufficient vitamin D status is associated with better outcomes in IVF. Nonetheless, there are many demographic, geographic and clinical parameters that may be related to vitamin D status that need to be ascertained before concluding that the better results are due to the higher levels of vitamin D.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/ivf-meta-sci-hub.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=ivf-20-40-more-succesful-when-eggs-were-collected-in-the-summer---july-2023>IVF 20-40% more succesful when eggs were collected in the summer - July 2023</h4><p><strong><a href=https://www.sciencealert.com/fertility-mystery-ivf-success-is-higher-if-eggs-harvested-in-summer>ScienceAlert</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=ivf-4x-more-successful-for-white-women-with-lots-of-vitamin-d--oct-2012>IVF 4X more successful for white women with lots of vitamin D – Oct 2012</h4><p><strong>Characterizing the influence of vitamin D levels on IVF outcomes</strong></p><p>Oxford Journals Medicine Human Reproduction Volume 27, Issue 11Pp. 3321-3327.</p><p>B.

Recently, several investigators have demonstrated higher IVF pregnancy rates in vitamin D replete women. The objective of this study was to validate these findings and to further elucidate the role of vitamin D in reproduction among a diverse group of women.</p><p>METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study in an academic tertiary care center of 188 infertile women undergoing IVF. Serum levels of vitamin D (25OH-D) were measured in previously frozen serum samples. The main outcome measure was clinical pregnancy, defined as sonographic presence of a heartbeat following IVF.</p><p>RESULTS The relationship between vitamin D status and pregnancy rates differed by race (P &lt; 0.01). Among non-Hispanic whites, pregnancy rates declined with progressively lower levels of vitamin D, while in Asians, the reverse was true. Adjusting for age and number and quality of embryos transferred among non-Hispanic whites, the odds of pregnancy were <strong>four times higher in vitamin D replete versus deficient patients</strong> . Live birth rates mirrored pregnancy rates. Vitamin D status was not associated with ovarian stimulation parameters or with markers of embryo quality.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS Vitamin D deficiency is associated with lower pregnancy rates in non-Hispanic whites, <strong>but not in Asians, possibly due to their lower IVF success rates</strong> . Vitamin D deficiency was not correlated with ovarian stimulation parameters or with markers of embryo quality, suggesting its effect may be mediated through the endometrium.</p><p><strong><span style=color:#00f>PDF is attached at the bottom of this page</span></strong></p><hr><h4 id=another-study-found-in-vitro-fertilization-2x-less-successful-if-low-vitamin-d--nov-2013>Another study found In vitro fertilization 2X less successful if low vitamin D – Nov 2013</h4><p><strong>Influence of vitamin D levels on in vitro fertilization outcomes in donor-recipient cycles.</strong></p><p>Fertil Steril. 2013 Nov 5. pii: S0015-0282(13)03154-3. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.10.008.>doi: 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.10.008.</a></p><p>Rudick BJ, Ingles SA, Chung K, Stanczyk FZ, Paulson RJ, Bendikson KA.</p><p>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Center for Women&rsquo;s Reproductive Health, Columbia University, New York, New York.

Our goal was to investigate whether vitamin D levels are predictive of implantation and clinical pregnancy rates in infertile women following in vitro fertilization (IVF).</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>We prospectively evaluated vitamin D status, as determined by serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels, in a cohort of 173 women undergoing IVF at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario. Serum 25(OH)D samples were collected within 1 week before oocyte retrieval. We classified patients as having sufficient (≥ 75 nmol/L) or insufficient (or deficient; hereafter referred to as &ldquo;insufficient&rdquo;; &lt; 75 nmol/L) serum levels of 25(OH)D. We compared patient demographics and IVF cycle parameters between groups. The primary outcome measure was clinical pregnancy (intrauterine sac visible on ultrasound performed 4-5 weeks after embryo transfer).</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Of the included women, 54.9% had insufficient 25(OH)D levels and 45.1% had sufficient levels.</p><p>Women with sufficient levels had significantly higher rates of clinical pregnancy per IVF cycle started <strong>(52.5%)</strong> compared with women with insufficient levels <strong>(34.7%;</strong> p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Implantation rates were also higher in the sufficient 25(OH)D group, but the results were not statistically significant. Multivariable logistic regression analysis (adjusted for age, body mass index and day 5 <span>[v. day 3]</span> embryo transfer) showed that serum 25(OH)D level may be a predictor of clinical pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.03).</p><p>INTERPRETATION:</p><p>Our findings suggest that women with sufficient levels of vitamin D are significantly more likely to achieve clinical pregnancy following IVF. Vitamin D supplementation could provide an easy and cost-effective way of improving pregnancy rates; this merits further investigation.</p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-levels-not-associated-with-ivf-success---sept-2014-disagrees-with-all-previous-studies>Vitamin D levels NOT associated with IVF success - Sept 2014 (disagrees with all previous studies)</h4><p><strong>Impact of circulating levels of total and bioavailable serum vitamin D on pregnancy rate in egg donation recipients</strong></p><p>Alberta Fabris, M.D.a, Alberto Pacheco, Ph.D.a, María Cruz, Ph.D.a, Jose Manuel Puente, M.D.a, Human Fatemi, M.D.b, Juan A.
