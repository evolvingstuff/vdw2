#### Experts Warn of Another Rise in U.S. COVID Cases as BA.2 Variant Spreads in Europe - March 15, 2022

 **[People Magazine](https://people.com/health/experts-warn-of-another-rise-in-u-s-covid-cases-as-europe-starts-to-spike-and-ba-2-variant-spreads/)** 

* "Wastewater samples — which can predict when COVID-19 infections will increase — show that U.S. cases are rising again"

* "Cases are climbing in the United Kingdom —  **up 48% in the last week — and in more than half of countries in the European Union** . The change appears to be due to several causes: the BA.2 subvariant of omicron, which is even more transmissible; the removal of pandemic mitigation efforts like mask mandates; and waning immunity from vaccination or prior infection."

#### COVID positive testing of waste water is surging, but cases are not - as of March 10, 2022

March 14 – Bloomberg (Drew Armstrong and Andre Tartar): “A wastewater network that monitors for Covid-19 trends is warning that cases are once again rising in many parts of the U.S., according to an analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data…. More than a third of the CDC’s wastewater sample sites across the U.S. showed rising Covid-19 trends in the period ending March 1 to March 10, **though reported cases have stayed near a recent low** . The number of sites with rising signals of Covid-19 cases is nearly twice what it was during the Feb. 1 to Feb. 10 period…”

#### COVID surge in Western Europe puts U.S. health experts on alert - March 17

 **[WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20220317/covid-surge-western-europe-us-experts)** 

No hyperlinks below

Infectious disease experts are watching BA.2, the Omicron subvariant that appears to be more transmissible than the original strain. BA.2 is fueling outbreaks across Europe and is growing in dominance across the U.S.

“It’s picking up steam. It’s across at least 12 countries … from Finland to Greece,” Eric Topol, MD, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told The Washington Post.

He has been following the surge and has posted recent charts of the outbreak on Twitter. Hospitalizations appear to be increasing in some places as well, he noted, despite the higher vaccination rates of many Western European countries.

“There’s no question there’s a significant wave there,” Topol said.

 **How Do COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines Work?** 

Some of the COVID-19 vaccines are known as mRNA shots. How are they different from traditional vaccines? And do they contain the real virus?

Germany recorded more than 260,000 new cases on Tuesday, according to the data tracker from The New York Times, but coronavirus restrictions are still being lifted this week. The U.K. is reporting more than 75,000 daily cases, and the Netherlands is reporting more than 60,000 daily cases, which are considered major numbers, compared to their population sizes. Meanwhile, France, Italy, and Switzerland are also reporting large increases in infections.

During the past 2 years, widespread outbreaks in Europe have been followed by similar surges in the U.S. weeks later. Most experts interviewed by the Post predicted that it’s likely to happen again.

In the U.S., the BA.2 subvariant accounted for 23% of new COVID-19 cases for the week ending March 12, according to the latest estimate from the CDC, while the original Omicron strain made up about 66% of cases. The BA.2 percentage is up from 13.7% of new cases for the week ending March 5, 7.1% the previous week, and 4.1% the week before that. In parts of the Northeast and New England, BA.2 makes up more than 38% of new cases.

At the same time, the 7 -day average of COVID-19 cases continues to drop in the U.S., with about 31,000 daily cases currently, the New York Times data tracker shows. About 25,000 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized across the country, which has fallen 44% in the past 2 weeks, and about  **1,200 deaths are being reported daily.** 

Several variables could affect the course of a future surge, the Post reported. Vaccination rates, coronavirus safety protocols, and access to antiviral medications could dictate how another wave unfolds across the country.

About 82% of the eligible U.S. population has received at least one vaccine dose, and 69% is fully vaccinated, according to the latest CDC data. About half of those who are eligible for booster doses have received one. In Germany, nearly 76% of people are fully vaccinated, the newspaper reported, and in the U.K., about 74% are fully vaccinated.

Health experts are also considering how natural immunity from a previous infection could affect a BA.2 surge. Millions of Americans were infected with the original Omicron strain, BA.1, which could provide protection. That said, researchers  **aren’t quite sure whether BA.1 infection protects against BA.2.** 

“It’s like a weather alert. Right now, the skies are sunny and bright, and we hope they stay that way,” Michael Osterholm, PhD, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told CNN.

“But we could have some bad weather by evening,” he said. “We just don’t know.”

#### Another Covid Surge May Be Coming. Are We Ready for It? - March 19, 2022

 **[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/19/health/covid-ba2-surge-variant.html?utm_source=pocket&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pockethits)** 

* “We’ve been wearing rose-colored glasses instead of correcting our vision,” one scientist said.

* "The clearest warnings that the brief period of quiet may soon be over have come, as they often have in the past two years, from Western Europe. In a number of countries, including Britain, France and Germany, case numbers are climbing as an even more contagious subvariant of Omicron, known as BA.2, takes hold."

* "In interviews, 10 epidemiologists and infectious disease experts said that many of the ingredients were in place for the same to happen in the United States, though it was unclear if or when a wave might hit or how severe it might be."

* "“I expect we’ll see a wave in the U.S. sooner than what most people expect,” said Kristian Andersen, a virologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif. He said that it could come  **as soon as April** , or perhaps later in the spring or the early summer."

* "The BA.2 subvariant began its march across Europe around the time that certain countries were lifting restrictions and mask mandates, potentially giving it extra kindling for its spread."

* "...nearly 1,200 Americans on average are dying each day from Covid"

   * more than Ukraine?
