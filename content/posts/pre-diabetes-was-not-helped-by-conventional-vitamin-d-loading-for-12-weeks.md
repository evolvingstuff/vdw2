BACKGROUND: Some epidemiological and interventional studies have shown the role of vitamin D on insulin secretion and resistance. A previous study in our center showed that intramuscular vitamin D decreases insulin sensitivity in pre-diabetic patients. We investigated the role of oral vitamin D on the insulin sensitivity index and insulin resistance in pre-diabetic patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a randomized clinical trial, we divided 45 people with pre-diabetes aged 47.4 ± 6.6 (range 33-61) years into three groups: 

* group A subjects treated with 50,000 IU oral vitamin D and 500 mg calcium carbonate (n = 21), 

* group B subjects treated with a single 300,000 IU intramuscular vitamin D and 500 mg calcium carbonate (n = 9), and 

* group C subjects treated with 500 mg calcium carbonate alone (n= 15). 

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH) D]</span> was measured at baseline.

* If it was less than 75 nmol/l, 50,000 IU vitamin D was given weekly, and 

* if serum 25(OH) D was more than that, vitamin D was administered every 2 weeks. 

Before and after 12 weeks of treatment, a 75-g glucose tolerance test was performed. 

We used paired t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to analyze the data. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

RESULTS: Mean (SD) of serum vitamin D increased from 77.5 ± 39.2 to 118.8 ± 56.3 nmol/l (P = 0.009) in group A and from 80 ± 36 to 102.8 ± 43.3 nmol/l (P = 0.053) in group B, and decreased from 44.8 ± 18.3 to 34.6 ± 13.9 nmol/l (P = 0.06) in group C. 

Insulin sensitivity index (Matsuda) decreased from 11.4 ± 3 to 9.9 ± 3.2 (P = 0.046) in group A, but in comparison with other groups, it was not significant.

CONCLUSION: Oral vitamin D had no effect on insulin sensitivity in pre-diabetes patients in 12 weeks treatment. 

A randomized double-blind study with a  **longer duration of treatment**  is suggested to investigate the effect of vitamin D on insulin resistance.

 **Note: 12 weeks is just barely long enough to restore vitamin D levels, but not make any changes.** 

Probably if this test had gone on for a few more weeks a significant decrease would have been observed in the insulin sensitivity index.
