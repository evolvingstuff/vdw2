 **<span style="color:#00F;">Best guess: 200,000 IU of vitamin D in a single day to rejuvinate immune system </span>** 

 **It appears that this will provide a <span style="color:#00F;">3X reduction</span> in the need to go to the hospital or experience COVID long-haul** 

 **Need to explore** 

* 100,000 in single day

* Large D followed up with small D dose in a week 

* Different form of D ( more bio-avaiable, faster acting, longer shelf life) - such as nanoemulsion

* Different dose sizes for obese, children,

* Different dose sizes for groups at high risk of having very low D - dark skin, elderly, not get much sun. winter, 

   * [Same dose of vitamin D for everyone is virtually impossible - Dec 2015](/posts/same-dose-of-vitamin-d-for-everyone-is-virtually-impossible)

* Different dose sizes for different health problems

* Add Vitamin D Receptor Activator  (known to help with various health problems such as Cancers and COVID

   * Greatly increases Vitamin D to the cells (Resveratrol, Curcumin, Quercetin...)

   * Can be in seperate or same pill

* Possibility of a single pill of say 200,000 IU + Resveratrol

 **Emergency vitamin D has a chance of stopping the global COVID-19 pandemic** 

* 3 billion people on the globe cannot afford vaccines

* The emergency Vitamin D supply could be shared across many people

   * example: 4 pills available to/owned/shared by 4 families (cost per familiy ~20 cents)

   * Thus 1 pill every 2 years for shared emergency dosing vs 50 pills per person over 2 years for bi-weekly dosing

      * This assumes that the pills have a maximum shelf-life of 2 years - it could be much longer

      * Note: Emergency dosing would require 50X less production than bi-weekly dosing 

 **The founder of VitaminDWiki sent out 200,000 IU Vitamin D Christmas cards (pills in a blister pack)**

 **Want to add references to loading dose success**
