#### The Pivotal Decision That Led to a Resurgence of Polio - Sept 2024

 **[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/07/health/polio-vaccine-gaza-children.html)** 

* "This journey was the consequence of a fateful decision by global health organizations to pare down the oral polio vaccine in 2016. The move, now called “the switch,” was intended to help eradicate the disease."

* "Instead, the change has led to outbreaks of polio in dozens of countries and has paralyzed more than 3,300 children. A formal evaluation, commissioned by the global polio eradication program and led by two independent experts, was unflinching in its assessment: “The switch was an unqualified failure.” "

* "The switch, in April 2016, was a remarkable event, with 155 countries and territories simultaneously replacing triple-hit vaccines with two-hit ones in two weeks."
