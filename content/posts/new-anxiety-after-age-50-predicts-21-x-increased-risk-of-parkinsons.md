#### Risk of Parkinson’s disease in people aged ≥50 years with new-onset anxiety: a retrospective cohort study in UK primary care

Background A history of anxiety is more common in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The prospective risk of PD in those newly presenting with anxiety and factors that increase the risk of PD in patients with anxiety have not been investigated.

Aim To investigate the incidence of PD in people with anxiety aged ≥50 years and clinical features associated with later diagnosis of PD in people with anxiety.

Design and setting A retrospective cohort study using UK primary care data between 2008 and 2018, assessing patients with new-onset anxiety aged ≥50 years.

Method Weibull survival regression models were fitted and hazard ratios (HRs) for modelling time-to-PD was estimated in those with and without anxiety, and when determining the risk of developing PD in those with anxiety. Results were adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, and relevant physical and mental health conditions.

Results The risk of PD increased two-fold compared with the non-anxiety group after adjustment for age, sex, social deprivation, lifestyle factors, severe mental illness, head trauma, and dementia (HR 2.1, 95% confidence interval = 1.9 to 2.4). In those with anxiety, the presence of depression, hypotension, tremor, rigidity, balance impairment, constipation, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and cognitive impairment were associated with an increased risk of developing PD.

Conclusion The risk of developing PD was at least doubled in people with anxiety compared with those without. The clinical features of those who developed PD can help identify patients presenting with anxiety who are in the prodromal phase of PD.
