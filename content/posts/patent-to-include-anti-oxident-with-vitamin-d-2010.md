## Clipped from patent

“However, cholecalciferol is seen to be very unstable and is  **especially unstable in the presence of oxygen** . It has therefore been difficult to provide formulations of cholecalciferol which are stable. This lack of stability may often be detected as a drop in the level of cholecalciferol in a formulation measured using a cholecalciferol assay.”

“The present invention provides a stable pharmaceutical delivery system comprising vitamin D or derivatives thereof, preferably cholecalciferol. In a first aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical delivery system comprising: i) an inert core, ii) an inner layer comprising vitamin D or a derivative thereof, preferably cholecalciferol, an emulsifier and an anti-oxidant, and iii) an outer protective layer.”

Wonder if oxidation is a portion of the reason that vitamin D does not appear to be very bio-available in a solid multi-vitamin
