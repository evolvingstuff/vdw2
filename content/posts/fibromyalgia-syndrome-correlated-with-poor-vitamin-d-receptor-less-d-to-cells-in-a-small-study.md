Purpose Vitamin D receptor (VDR) has been proposed as a possible marker for fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). The purpose of this study is to characterize the expression pattern of BsmI polymorphism (rs1544410) in the VDR gene in women with FMS and the genotype-phenotype association.

Methods A total of 105 FMS patients and 105 controls were included in this study. VDR gene BsmI polymorphism was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymerase (RFLP) method. 

Results There was no significant difference in the frequency distribution of both genotypes and alleles for VDR gene BsmI polymorphism between FMS patients and controls (p>0.05). The frequencies of BB, Bb, and bb in the VDR gene BsmI polymorphism were 19%, 43%, and 37% in patients, while in controls were 22.9%, 55.2%, and 21.9%. However, we did not find any significant association between the clinical symptoms of this disease and VDR BsmI genotypes among FMS patients (p>0.05). 

Conclusions The relationship between the VDR gene BsmI polymorphism and FMS could not be determined in this study. However, further studies with a larger sample size may be required to show a relation between the VDR gene BsmI polymorphism and FMS.
