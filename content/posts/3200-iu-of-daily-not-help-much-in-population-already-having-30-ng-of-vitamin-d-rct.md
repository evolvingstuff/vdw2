Background: Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with risks of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancer in observational studies, but evidence for benefits with vitamin D supplementation is limited. Objectives: To investigate the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on CVD and cancer incidences.

Methods: The study was a 5-year, randomized, placebo-controlled trial among 2495 male participants >60 years and post-menopausal female participants >65 years from a general Finnish population who were free of prior CVD or cancer. The study had 3 arms: placebo, 1600 IU/day, or 3200 IU/day vitamin D3. Follow-up was by annual study questionnaires and national registry data. A representative subcohort of 551 participants had more detailed in-person investigations. The primary endpoints were incident major CVD and invasive cancer. Secondary endpoints included the individual components of the primary CVD endpoint (myocardial infarction, stroke, and CVD mortality), site-specific cancers, and cancer death.

Results: During the follow-up, there were 41 (4.9%), 42 (5.0%), and 36 (4.3%) major CVD events in the placebo, 1600 IU/d (compared with placebo: HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.63-1.49; P = 0.89), and 3200 IU/d (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.54-1.31; P = 0.44) arms, respectively. Invasive cancer was diagnosed in 41 (4.9%), 48 (5.8%), and 40 (4.8%) participants in the placebo, 1600 IU/d (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.75-1.72; P = 0.55), and 3200 IU/d (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.61-1.47; P = 0.81) arms, respectively. There were no significant differences in the secondary endpoints or total mortality. In the subcohort, the mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was 75 nmol/L (SD, 18 nmol/L). After 12 months, the concentrations were 73 nmol/L (SD, '8 nmol/L), '00 nmol/L (SD, 2' nmol/L), and '20 nmol/L (SD, 22 nmol/L) in the placebo, '600 IU/d, and 3200 IU/d arms, respectively.

Conclusions: Vitamin D3 supplementation did not lower the incidences of major CVD events or invasive cancer among older adults, possibly due to sufficient vitamin D status in most participants at baseline.
