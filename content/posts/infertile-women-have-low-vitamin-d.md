#### Relationship between Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels and Hormonal Status in Infertile Women: A Retrospective Study

Diagnostics (Basel). 2023 Sep 22;13(19):3024. [doi: 10.3390/diagnostics13193024.](https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics13193024.)

Background: Infertility is a prevalent issue that affects 10-18% of couples worldwide, and up to 30% in Eastern Europe. Infertility of unknown etiology is one of the most challenging forms of infertility. Vitamin D has recently been extensively studied and researchers are investigating its possible role in ovulation and pregnancy. While the evidence suggests a positive association between vitamin D and ovulation, more research is needed to understand the role that vitamin D plays in ovulation. 

Methods: In this study, 86 infertile patients were studied retrospectively in a single center by analyzing their anthropometric (body mass index), biochemical (total cholesterol, insulin resistance) and hormonal data in correlation with their vitamin D status. (3)

 Results: It was found that the mid-luteal progesterone level was significantly related to the 25-hydroxy vitamin D level in a multivariate linear regression model. An analysis of subgroups of ovulatory and anovulatory patients suggests that serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels of approximately 20 ng/mL may be necessary to trigger ovulation or to support progesterone secretion. (4) 

Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency should be considered when infertility of unknown etiology and progesterone-related disorders occur.
