#### Atopic dermatitis is associated with Caesarean sections in Korean adolescents but asthma is not.

AIM:

Studies on the associations between mode of delivery and allergic diseases have produced different results and research has rarely been conducted in Asian countries such as South Korea. This study assessed the relationship between mode of delivery and atopic dermatitis and asthma in Korean adolescents.

METHODS:

Data collected from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2010 and 2011 were used. We included 1,302 adolescents aged from 12-18 years and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed.

RESULTS:

The odds ratio (OR) of having atopic dermatitis was 1.50, with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 1.01-2.22, after adjusting for age and sex. The association remained significant after further adjustments for body mass index, breastfeeding and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.05-2.47) and when fat intake was added to those variables (OR =  **1.80** , 95% CI = 1.14-2.85). However, asthma was not associated with mode of delivery in any of the models.

CONCLUSIONS:

Atopic dermatitis in adolescents was associated with Caesarean delivery, which is common in South Korea. The findings suggest that the frequency of this practice should be reconsidered and that further research with longitudinal evaluation of relevant mechanisms is needed.
