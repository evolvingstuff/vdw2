 **Deficiency = 12 ng** 

<div class="border" style="background-color:#FFFAE2;padding:15px;margin:10px 0;border-radius:5px;width:800px">

 **Based on Vitamin D tests were made sometime in the previous 10 years** 

 **82% of Arab females had < 20 ng** 

 **1.8 X higher risk if <12 ng vs >30 ng - independent of sex, race** 

Study does not appear to have information on vitamin D levels and 

* infection severity (ICU, death, etc)

* asymtomatic

* long-haul, etc. 

Note: Those people increasing their vitamin D levels due to fear of COVID-19 would not be representing properly in these charts

Study noted: Recent Vitamin D drops associated with a 20% reduction in COVID-19 infection

Speculated that the drops increased Vitamin D levels in the mouth

VitaminDWiki speculates: [inhaled Vitamin D](/posts/inhaled-vitamin-d-help-lungs-many-studies) would be even better than drops
