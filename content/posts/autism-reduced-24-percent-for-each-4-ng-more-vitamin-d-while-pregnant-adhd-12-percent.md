#### High-dose vitamin D3 supplementation in pregnancy and risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in the children at age 10: A randomized clinical trial

Am J Clin Nutr . 2024 Feb;119(2):362-370. [doi: 10.1016/j.ajcnut.2023.12.002](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2023.12.002)

Background: Vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy may increase the risk of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation in pregnancy on risk of autism and ADHD.

Design: This randomized clinical trial was part of the COpenhagen Prospective Study on Neuro-PSYCHiatric Development (COPYCH) project nested within the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC2010) cohort comprising a population-based sample of 700 healthy mother-child pairs enrolled at week 24 of pregnancy. Maternal 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) was measured at inclusion and 623 mothers were randomized 1:1 to either high-dose (2800 IU/d) or standard dose (400 IU/d) vitamin D3 until 1 wk postpartum (315 received high-dose, 308 standard dose). At age 10, diagnoses and symptom load of autism and ADHD, respectively, were established using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version.

Results: The psychopathologic evaluation was completed by 591 children aged 10 y, and 16 children (2.7%) were diagnosed with autism and 65 (11.0%) with ADHD. Hereof, 496 children participated in the vitamin D3 trial (246 received high-dose, 250 standard dose). Of these, 12 children (2.4%) were diagnosed with autism and 58 (11.7%) with ADHD. Higher maternal preintervention 25(OH)D levels were associated with a  **decreased risk of autism [odd ratio (OR) per 10 nmol/L: 0.76**  (0.59,0.97); P = 0.034], lower autistic symptom load [β per 10 nmol/L: -0.03 (-0.05,0.00); P = 0.024), and  **decreased risk of ADHD diagnosis (OR per 10 nmol/L: 0.88** (0.78,0.99); P = 0.033](β per 10 nmol/L: -0.03 (-0.05,0.00); P = 0.024), and __decreased risk of ADHD diagnosis (OR per 10 nmol/L: 0.88 __(0.78,0.99); P = 0.033). High-dose vitamin D3 supplementation was not associated with risk of autism or ADHD.

Conclusions: Higher maternal preintervention 25(OH)D was associated with a decreased risk of autism, lower autistic symptom load, and decreased risk of ADHD diagnosis, but high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation in pregnancy had no effect on risk of autism and ADHD. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00856947.

Background: Vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy may increase the risk of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation in pregnancy on risk of autism and ADHD.

Design: This randomized clinical trial was part of the COpenhagen Prospective Study on Neuro-PSYCHiatric Development (COPYCH) project nested within the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC2010) cohort comprising a population-based sample of 700 healthy mother-child pairs enrolled at week 24 of pregnancy. Maternal 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) was measured at inclusion and 623 mothers were randomized 1:1 to either high-dose (2800 IU/d) or standard dose (400 IU/d) vitamin D3 until 1 wk postpartum (315 received high-dose, 308 standard dose). At age 10, diagnoses and symptom load of autism and ADHD, respectively, were established using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version.

Results: The psychopathologic evaluation was completed by 591 children aged 10 y, and 16 children (2.7%) were diagnosed with autism and 65 (11.0%) with ADHD. Hereof, 496 children participated in the vitamin D3 trial (246 received high-dose, 250 standard dose). Of these, 12 children (2.4%) were diagnosed with autism and 58 (11.7%) with ADHD. Higher maternal preintervention 25(OH)D levels were associated with a __decreased risk of autism [odd ratio (OR) per 10 nmol/L: 0.76__ (0.59,0.97); P = 0.034], lower autistic symptom load [β per 10 nmol/L: -0.03 (-0.05,0.00); P = 0.024), and __decreased risk of ADHD diagnosis (OR per 10 nmol/L: 0.88 __(0.78,0.99); P = 0.033]. High-dose vitamin D3 supplementation was not associated with risk of autism or ADHD.

Conclusions: Higher maternal preintervention 25(OH)D was associated with a decreased risk of autism, lower autistic symptom load, and decreased risk of ADHD diagnosis, but high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation in pregnancy had no effect on risk of autism and ADHD. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00856947.
