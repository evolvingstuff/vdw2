Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific illness that is hypothesized to occur due to vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy. Therefore, vitamin D supplementation in early pregnancy should be explored for preventing preeclampsia and promoting neonatal well-being. The present study follows a case-control analysis that aims to determine the effect of vitamin D supplements on reducing the probability of recurrent preeclampsia. We identified 59 patients for the control group without vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy, while 139 patients were included in the cases group of pregnant women with a history of preeclampsia who confirmed taking daily vitamin D supplements in either 2000 UI or 4000 UI until the 36th week of pregnancy. There were 61 (80.3%) patients with a normal serum vitamin D level measured at 32 weeks in the pregnant women who took a daily dose of 4000 UI vitamin D and 43 (68.3%) in those who took a 2000 UI dose of vitamin D, compared to just 32 (54.2%) in those who did not take vitamin D at all. Regarding the blood pressure of pregnant women measured at 32 weeks, it was observed that 20.3% were hypertensive in the no supplementation group, compared to only 11.1% and 6.6% in those who were taking vitamin D during pregnancy (p-value = 0.049). Serum vitamin D levels at 32 weeks were measured at an average value of 23.9 ng/mL, compared with 28.4 ng/mL in the group taking a 2000 UI daily dose and 33.6 in those who supplemented with 4000 UI daily (p-value < 0.001). 

Proteinuria was identified more often in the group at risk for preeclampsia who did not take vitamin D supplements, while systolic blood pressure (p-value = 0.036) as well as diastolic blood pressure (p-value = 0.012), were all identified to have significantly higher values in the pregnant women with a history of preeclampsia that did not take vitamin D during the current pregnancy. 

The significant risk factors for preeclampsia development in pregnant patients at risk are: insufficient vitamin D serum levels (<20 ng/mL), OR = 2.52; no vitamin D supplementation, OR = 1.46; more than two pregnancies, OR = 1.89; gestational diabetes mellitus, OR = 1.66; and cardiovascular comorbidities, OR = 2.18. These findings imply that vitamin D has a role in the preservation of placental function and, therefore, in the prevention of the development of late preeclampsia. Pregnant mothers who supplemented their diets with vitamin D were protected against preeclampsia recurrence. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy may aid in the prevention of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.
