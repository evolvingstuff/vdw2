#### Post-Diagnosis Vitamin D Supplement Use and Survival among Cancer Patients: A Meta-Analysis

Nutrients 2022, 14(16), 3418; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14163418

Vitamin D administered pre-diagnostically has been shown to reduce mortality. Emerging evidence suggests a role of post-diagnosis vitamin D supplement intake for survival among cancer patients. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship. PubMed and Embase were searched for relevant observational cohort studies and randomized trials published through April 2022. Summary relative risk (SRR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using the DerSimonian–Laird random-effects model. 

The SRR for post-diagnosis vitamin D supplement use vs. non-use, pooling cohort studies and randomized trials, was 

* 0.87 (95% CI, 0.78–0.98; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%) for overall survival, 

* 0.81 (95% CI, 0.62–1.06; p = 0.12; I2 = 51%) for progression-free survival, 

* 0.86 (95% CI, 0.72–1.03; p = 0.10; I2 = 0%) for cancer-specific survival, and

* 0.86 (95% CI, 0.64–1.14; p = 0.29; I2 = 0%) for relapse. 

Albeit not significantly heterogeneous by variables tested, a significant inverse association was limited to cohort studies and supplement use during cancer treatment for overall survival, and to studies with ≤3 years of follow-up for progression-free survival.  **Post-diagnosis vitamin D supplement use was associated with improved overall survival** , but not progression-free or cancer-specific survival or relapse. Our findings require confirmation, as randomized trial evidence was insufficient to establish cause-and-effect relationships.

#### 13% fewer deaths (most the of RCT provided a paltry <2,000 IU of vitamin D)

 **VitaminDWiki would expect a 30% reduction in deaths if reasonable loading and maintenace doses were to be used**
