#### T-cells need at least 40-50 ng of Vitamin D to fight COVID-19 - June 2021

T-lymphocytes require a level of  **minimum 40ng/mL (optimally 50)**  in order to function properly (internal cell signaling). For example, [India](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4018438/) has a severe insufficiency of vitamin D (97% for adults and elderly had 91% outright deficiency (<20ng/ml).

Evidence indicates that persons with auto-immunity often have a [CD8+ T-cell deficiency](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ad/2012/189096/). CD8+T-cells express the highest amount of the Vitamin D receptors of all immune system cells and can be upregulated with high-dose Vitamin D. A [rapid and competent response](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590136220300231) by CD8+T-cells is a game-changer in COVID-19 outcomes.  “Antibody response is often a poor marker of prior coronavirus infection, particularly in mild infections, and is shorter-lived than virus-reactive T-cells”

Researchers argue that monitoring and assessing circulating vitamin D levels status and clinical prognostic indices in COVID-19 patients is critical in the responding. “[Vitamin D deficiency](https://respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12931-021-01666-3) is associated with compromised inflammatory responses and higher pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 affected patients. Vitamin D assessment, during COVID-19 infection, could be a useful analysis for possible therapeutic interventions”.

Researchers report that in order [for T cells to become active](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=t-cells-multiply-fight-infection) members of the body's immune system, “they must transition from so-called ["naive" T cells](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/another-reason-vitamin-d-is-important-it-gets-t-cells-going/) into either killer cells or helper cells (which are charged with "remembering" specific invaders). And, if ample vitamin D is not around, the T cells do not make that crucial transition”. "When a T cell is exposed to a foreign pathogen, it extends a signaling device of '[antenna](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/another-reason-vitamin-d-is-important-it-gets-t-cells-going/)' known as a vitamin D receptor, with which it searches for vitamin D," Geisler said in a prepared statement. If there is an inadequate vitamin D level, he noted, "they won't even begin to mobilize."

Persons with auto-immunity need higher doses of Vitamin D to modulate the immune system.  [“A 2009 Archives of Internal Medicine study](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=vitamin-d-deficiency-united-states) found that 77 percent of U.S. adults and teenagers surveyed did not have the estimated minimum healthful level of 30 nanograms per milliliter in their blood. And just three percent of blacks in the survey were getting [enough of the vitamin](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/another-reason-vitamin-d-is-important-it-gets-t-cells-going/)”.
