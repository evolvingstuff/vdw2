Men and women with self-reported fatigue who were vitamin D deficient

Gave them a single 100,000 IU dose of vitamin D or placebo

Fatigue assessment scale at one month: -3.3 for vitamin D vs -0.8 for placebo

 **VitaminDWiki Comment** 

* It is unlikely that 100,000 IU would have gotten many participants to a good level of vitamin D

* Expect far more reduction in fatigue (as well as pain) if use a loading dose of 400,000 IU 

* To keep the pain away, a the loading dose needs to be followed by maintenance doses

> Typically 50,000 IU every two weeks

BACKGROUND:

Vitamin D deficiency is frequent and has been associated with fatigue in uncontrolled trials.

METHODS:

This is the first double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of per os vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in treating fatigue among otherwise healthy persons with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels. We enrolled 120 individuals (mean age 29 ± 6 years, 53% women) presenting with fatigue and vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D < 20 µg/L). Participants were randomized to a single oral dose of 100,000 units of vitamin D or placebo. The primary endpoint was intra-individual change in the fatigue assessment scale (FAS) at 4 weeks after treatment.

RESULT:

The mean age of the participants was 29 ± 6 years, 53% were women. Mean FAS decreased significantly more in the vitamin D group (-3.3 ± 5.3; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> for change -14.1 to 4.1) compared with placebo (-0.8 ± 5.3; 95% CI for change -9.0 to 8.7); (P = 0.01). Amelioration of fatigue was reported more frequently in vitamin D than in placebo group (42 <span>[72%]</span> vs. 31 <span>[50%]</span>; P = 0.01; odds ratio <span>[OR]</span> 2.63, 95% CI for OR 1.23-5.62). Among all participants, improvement in fatigue score correlated with the rise in 25(OH)D level (R = -0.22, P = 0.02).

CONCLUSION:

Vitamin D treatment significantly improved fatigue in otherwise healthy persons with vitamin D deficiency.
