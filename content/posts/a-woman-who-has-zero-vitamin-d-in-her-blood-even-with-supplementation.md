 **The measured Vitamin D in the blood is semi-activated Vitamin D  
 &nbsp;  
It is carried by Vitamin D binding protein  
 &nbsp;  
A large % of the activated vitamin D which gets to the tissues of the body was never semiactivated vitamin D in the blood  
 &nbsp;  
"Large %" estimates range from 50% to 90%   
 &nbsp;  
This woman does have fully activated vitamin D in her tissues, but it was probably fully activated locally, and not by the liver & kidneys  
 &nbsp;  
Her body just uses the right pathway of the diagram below**

 **This study appears to be unaware of the right-hand pathway**
