Introduction

Evidence from clinical trials supports the efficacy of oral magnesium supplementation in the treatment of glucose-related disorders. Thus, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using oral magnesium chloride (MgCl2) in prediabetes treatment.

Methods

A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. For such purpose, we used original information from a randomized controlled clinical trial. Analysis was carried out based on a health services provider perspective, a  **10-year time horizon** , and 3% discount rate for costs and effectiveness. Taking into account risk factor profiles, a Markov micro-simulation model was used, and a probabilistic sensibility analysis was performed.

Results

The oral MgCl2 was dominant with lower cost and greater effectiveness as compared with placebo. As compared with placebo, 22.3% and 22.0% of men using MgCl2 did not develop diabetes or cardiovascular disease. The cost per person of using MgCl2 as compared with placebo, in the individuals without complications, was $2206 versus $4048 USD for men, and $1984 versus $3272 USD for women. The sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the base case.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that using oral MgCl2 for at least 4 months, in adults with prediabetes and hypomagnesemia, is a cost-effective option for reducing complications and direct medical costs.
