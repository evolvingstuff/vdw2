#### ICU stays linked to a doubling of dementia risk

 **[MDEdge](https://www.mdedge.com/neurology/article/256725/alzheimers-cognition/icu-stays-linked-doubling-dementia-risk?ecd=WNL_eve_220801_mdedge)** 

* "The Rush team assessed the impact of an ICU stay on dementia risk in 3,822 older adults (mean age, 77 years) without known dementia at baseline participating in five diverse epidemiologic cohorts."

* "In models further adjusted for other health factors such as vascular risk factors and disease, other chronic medical conditions and functional disabilities, the association was even stronger: ICU hospitalization was associated with roughly double the risk of  **Alzheimer’s dementia (HR 2.10** ; 95% CI, 1.66-2.65) and all-type  **dementia (HR, 2.20** ; 95% CI, 1.75-2.77)."

   * Vitamin D was NOT mentioned as a possibility

 **Surgery is known to cut Vitamin D levels in half in 2-3 days**
