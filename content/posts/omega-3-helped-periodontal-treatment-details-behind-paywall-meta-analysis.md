COMMENTARY AND ANALYSIS

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are omega-3 fatty acids found in oily fish and fish oil supplements. Clinical and preclinical studies indicate that these polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids are used as host-modulating therapy in various chronic inflammatory diseases.1 Several mechanisms have been identified by which omega-3 fatty acids influence various aspects of inflammatory responses mainly via production of eicosanoids, proinflammatory cytokine inhibition and . . . .
