### The International Covid Summit III in the European Parliament, Brussels â€“ May 3, 2023

This was live streamed the day of the event but for those that missed all or part of the 8 hours of testimony, below are videos of the morning and afternoon session - with all of the speakers and the titles of their presentations listed below the videos.

This was an historic event, and I am proud to have been a part of it. Most of the speakers, myself included paid our own way to attend and make this event happen. My fellow scientists and physicians are dedicated to medical freedom and getting data about COVID-19 out to the world. I also again wish to thank the people who donated to make this happen.
