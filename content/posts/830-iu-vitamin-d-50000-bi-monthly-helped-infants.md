INTRODUCTION: The present study was designed to compare two methods of vitamin D supplementation in infants: every two months as a routine vaccination versus a daily dose.

METHODS: A randomised clinical trial was performed on 120 healthy breastfed infants between January and September 2007 in Yazd, Iran. The infants were randomly divided into three groups with different doses of  **vitamin D3**  supplementation: 200 IU daily, 400 IU daily and a bolus of  **50,000 IU every two months** . A blood sample was taken and evaluated for 25-hydroxy vitamin D and calcium levels when the infants were six months old. The data was reported as the mean and standard deviation.

RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in the groups administered with 200 IU and 400 IU vitamin D daily. However, the serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D reached significance in the third group (p is less than 0.001). All the blood calcium measured was below 11 mg/dl in the bolus group. A few complications such as diarrhoea and agitation, all of which were self-limited, were seen in the bolus group. No other significant side effects were reported in the other groups.

CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a bolus of 50,000 IU of vitamin D every two months with a routine child vaccination program provides the ideal serum level of vitamin D. This method produces no serious side effects and offers a highly convenient way to supply vitamin D, especially among non-compliant parents. PMID: 20593151  free text on-line
