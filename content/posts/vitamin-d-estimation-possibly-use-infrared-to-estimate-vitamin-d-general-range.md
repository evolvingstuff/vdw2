 **Might be able to indicate that vitamin D is in one of a few ranges:  low, OK, high, and perhaps too high** 

 **Guess: in a few years this might be a commercial way to estimate levels of vitamin D - perhaps without drawing blood**

 **Similar sensors might estimate Vitamin D in the future** 

 **Wavelengths of a few IR LEDs which could be used**

Purpose: The aim of the present study was to develop a simple and accurate way to measure vitamin D levels. Vitamin D nowadays is measured by a variety of methods which their common drawbacks are expensive equipment and the need for high trained technical staff. In this research we measured vitamin D levels by means of Fourier transform infra red method in conjugation with the evanescent wave spectroscopy technique, in order to develop a simpler vitamin D measurement method. 

Methods: Blood samples were collected from patients with vitamin D deficiency at five intervals before and up to 16 days after they took a dose of 200,000 IU vitamin D3. Samples were measured by the conventional bio-chemical method and by the evanescent wave spectroscopy means. 

Results: Correlation was found between the vitamin D levels measured by the traditional method and by the evanescent wave spectroscopy technique. The absorption lines occurred prominently in the IR spectral regions of the Amide I (≈1650 cm−1),Amide II (≈1530 cm−1) and the (≈3400 cm−1) absorption band which is attributed to the hydroxyl group indicated by the O-H stretch. In addition, the examination of the blood samples using the evanescent wave spectroscopy with clustering techniques facilitated the discrimination between vitamin D deficiency and normal vitamin D levels. 

Practical relevance: This study demonstrates the potential of using the Fourier transform infra red method in conjugation with the evanescent wave spectroscopy technique coupled with multivariate analysis as a non- expensive, rapid and accurate alternative to the routine methodologies.
