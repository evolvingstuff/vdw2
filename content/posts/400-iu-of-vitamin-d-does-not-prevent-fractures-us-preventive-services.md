US Preventive Services Task Force Evidence Report, April 17, 2018

Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force

Leila C. Kahwati, MD, MPH1,2; Rachel Palmieri Weber, PhD1,3; Huiling Pan, BA1,2; et al Margaret Gourlay, MD, MPH1,4; Erin LeBlanc, MD, MPH5; Manny Coker-Schwimmer, MPH1,3; Meera Viswanathan, PhD1,2

#### They narrowed the analysis of Vitamin D in preventing fractures to just 4 studies

1 study used 300 IU – far too little

1 study used 400 IU – far too little

1 study used  100,000 IU every 3 months (both too little and too infrequent)

1 study  used 100,000 IU monthly – the only study which had the possibility of reducing fractures
