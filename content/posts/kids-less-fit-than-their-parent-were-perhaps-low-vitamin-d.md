### Children’s cardiovascular fitness declining worldwide

[American Heart Association Meeting Report: Abstract 13498](http://newsroom.heart.org/news/childrens-cardiovascular-fitness-declining-worldwide%20) November 19, 2013

* Around the globe, children are about 15 percent less fit than their parents were when they were young.

* In the United States, kids’ cardiovascular endurance performance declined about 6 percent per decade between 1970 and 2000.

* Across nations, endurance has declined consistently by about 5 percent every decade.

* In a mile run, kids today are about a minute and a half slower than their peers 30 years ago.

* Researchers analyzed 50 studies on running fitness between 1964 and 2010 that involved more than 25 million kids, ages 9 to 17, in 28 countries.
