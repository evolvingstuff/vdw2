 **Highlights** 

* Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) mobilise skin stores of nitric oxide metabolites.

* In this cohort of U.K. adults, UVR exposure was greater in summer than in winter.

* Plasma nitrite concentration was higher and blood pressure lower in the summer.

* A lower availability of nitric oxide may increase cardiovascular risk in winter months.

Background

Nitric oxide is a key signalling molecule that elicits a range of biological functions to maintain vascular homeostasis. A reduced availability of nitric oxide is implicated in the progression of cardiovascular diseases and increases the risk of pathogenic events.

Aims

To compare the concentration of nitric oxide metabolites in healthy adults between winter and summer months.

Design

An observational study of healthy adults (age 32 ± 9 years) living in central Scotland.

Methods

Thirty-four healthy adults (13 females) were monitored for 7 days in summer and winter to record sunlight exposure (ultraviolet-A (UV-A) radiation), diet, and physical activity. At the end of each phase, blood pressure was measured, and samples of blood and saliva collected. The samples were analysed to determine the concentrations of plasma and salivary nitrate and nitrite and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D).

Results

The participants maintained similar diets in each measurement phase but were exposed to more UV-A radiation (550%) and undertook more moderate-vigorous physical activity (23%) in the summer than in winter. Plasma nitrite (46%) and serum 25(OH)D (59%) were higher and blood pressure was lower in the summer compared to winter months. Plasma nitrite concentration was negatively associated with systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure.

Conclusions

Plasma nitrite, an established marker of nitric oxide synthesis, is higher in healthy adults during the summer than in winter. This may be mediated by a greater exposure to UV-A which stimulates the release of nitric oxide metabolites from skin stores. While it is possible that seasonal variation in nitric oxide availability may contribute to an increased blood pressure in the winter months, the overall impact on cardiovascular health remains to be determined.

#### Light-induced nitric oxide release in the skin beyond UVA and blue light: Red & near-infrared wavelengths -  Dec 2021

 **Nitric Oxide (journal)**  Volume 117  1 December 2021, Pages 16-25

Barolet b d [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.niox.2021.09.003](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.niox.2021.09.003)  **<i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/no-uva-and-ir-compresspdf.pdf">PDF</a>** 

 **Highlights** 

* This extensive review summarizes light-induced nitric oxide (NO) release mechanisms in the skin.

* Established UVA and blue light spectra are capable of releasing NO in human skin through enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways.

* Alternatively, the use of safer non-ionizing wavelengths in the red / near-infrared spectra can also release cutaneous NO, presumably using enzymatic pathways.

* A brief overview on rising polymeric NO donors promoting skin NO release explains potential medical applications.

* Lastly, most recent light-induced therapeutic approaches and biomedical applications involving NO release are portrayed, with their potential local and distant effects in the body.

#### The Remarkable Potential of Humming to STOP the Pandemic - Jan 2024

##### Asked Perplexity AI: What generated the most Nitric Oxide: The sun, humming, or breathing thru the nose?

 **[April 2024 includes references](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/What-generated-the-FVB7Rh1TQhKWVUNiWz9XwA)** 

The generation of nitric oxide (NO) can be influenced by various factors including sun exposure, humming, and nasal breathing. Each of these activities stimulates NO production in different ways and contexts.

1.  **Sun Exposure:** 

> Sun exposure, particularly to ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation, induces the release of nitric oxide from the skin. Studies have shown that low-dose sunlight exposure does not significantly increase cell death or DNA damage, which is beneficial for safely increasing NO production[4](https://nutrigardens.com/blogs/blog/skin-health-8-benefits-of-sunlight-the-natural-nitric-oxide-booster)[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13399-4)[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6830553/). The skin releases nitric oxide when exposed to UVA sunlight, and this process continues to produce NO even hours after the initial exposure[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13399-4). This suggests that sun exposure can be a potent inducer of nitric oxide due to the direct activation of NO synthesis in the skin.

1.  **Humming:** 

> Humming significantly increases nasal nitric oxide production. The act of humming creates oscillations that are thought to enhance air exchange between the nasal passages and the paranasal sinuses, thereby increasing the release of nitric oxide [10](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12119224/) [13](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.200202-138bc)  [18](https://www.buteykobreathing.nz/blog/potential-immune-protective-effects-nitric-oxide-and-humming). Studies have quantified this increase, noting that humming can raise nasal NO levels by up to 15 to 20 times compared to silent breathing [13](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.200202-138bc) [18](https://www.buteykobreathing.nz/blog/potential-immune-protective-effects-nitric-oxide-and-humming).

1.  **Nasal Breathing:** 

> Nasal breathing naturally produces nitric oxide, which is beneficial for various physiological functions including oxygen circulation in the body[8](https://www.healthline.com/health/nose-breathing). The nose acts as a reservoir for nitric oxide, and nasal breathing helps in releasing this NO into the respiratory tract, aiding in functions such as blood vessel dilation and lowering blood pressure[7](https://thorax.bmj.com/content/54/10/947)[8](https://www.healthline.com/health/nose-breathing). However, the increase in NO levels from regular nasal breathing, while significant for physiological health, is generally less dramatic compared to the increases seen with humming.

In summary, while all three activities contribute to the production of nitric oxide, humming results in the highest immediate increase in nitric oxide levels, specifically in the nasal passages. Sun exposure also significantly promotes NO production but does so primarily in the skin and continues over a longer duration post-exposure. Nasal breathing consistently produces NO but at lower levels compared to the acute increases observed with humming.
