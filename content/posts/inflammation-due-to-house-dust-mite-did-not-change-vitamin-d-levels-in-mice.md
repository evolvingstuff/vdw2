#### House Dust Mite Induced Lung Inflammation Does Not Alter Circulating Vitamin D Levels - 2014

Low circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> are associated with chronic lung diseases such as asthma. However, it is unclear whether vitamin D is involved in disease pathogenesis or is modified by the inflammation associated with the disease process. We hypothesized that allergic inflammation decreases the level of circulating 25(OH)D and tested this using a mice model of house dust mite (HDM) induced allergic airway inflammation. Cellular influx was measured in bronchoalvelar lavage (BAL) fluid, and allergic sensitization and 25(OH)D levels were measured in serum. Exposure to HDM caused a robust inflammatory response in the lung that was enhanced by prior influenza infection. These responses were not associated with any change in circulating levels of 25(OH)D. These data suggest that alterations in circulating 25(OH)D levels induced by Th-2 driven inflammation are unlikely to explain the cross-sectional epidemiological association between vitamin D deficiency and asthma.

 **All of the mice were getting adequate levels of vitamin D in their food (2000 IU/kg of feed)** 

 **So we should expect that the vitamin D levels in the blood would not drop**

#### House Dust Mite Sensitization Is Inversely Associated with Plasma 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 Levels in Patients with Severe Atopic Dermatitis - 2017

Ann Dermatol. 2017 Aug;29(4):400-406. [doi: 10.5021/ad.2017.29.4.400.](https://doi.org/10.5021/ad.2017.29.4.400.) Epub 2017 Jun 21.

BACKGROUND:

The relationship between atopic dermatitis (AD) and low vitamin D levels has been studied. Emerging evidence has implicated vitamin D as a critical regulator of immunity, playing a role in both the innate and cell-mediated immune systems. However, the effect of vitamin D on house dust mite (HDM) sensitization in patients with AD has not been established.

OBJECTIVE:We investigated the association between vitamin D levels and HDM sensitization according to AD severity.

METHODS:

In total, 80 patients (43 men and 37 women) with AD were included. We classified AD severity using Rajka and Langeland scores. Laboratory tests included serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, total immunoglobulin E (IgE), and specific IgE antibody titer against Dermatophagoides farinae and D. pteronyssinus.

RESULTS:

There were no differences in vitamin D levels between the mild or moderate AD and severe AD groups. In the severe AD group, high HDM sensitization group had lower serum vitamin D levels compared to low HDM sensitization group with statistical significance. In addition, a significant negative correlation was found between vitamin D levels and HDM sensitization in the severe AD group.

CONCLUSION:

Our results demonstrate that low vitamin D levels may link to high HDM sensitization in patients with the severe AD. Further elucidation of the role of vitamin D in HDM sensitization may hold profound implications for the prevention and treatment of AD.
