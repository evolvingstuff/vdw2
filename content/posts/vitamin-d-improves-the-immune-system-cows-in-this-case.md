#### Vitamin D in dairy cows: metabolism, status and functions in the immune system

The function of vitamin D in calcium homoeostasis in dairy cows, such as in other vertebrates, is known for many years. In recent years, new and interesting, non-classical functions of vitamin D have been elucidated, including effects on the immune system. The major aim of this review is to provide an overview of effects of vitamin D or its metabolites on the immune system in dairy cows. The first part of the review provides an overview of vitamin D metabolism, with particular reference to the role of various proteins (25- and 1-hydroxylases, vitamin D binding protein, vitamin D receptor) in vitamin D signalling. The second part deals with the role of the concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> in plasma as an indicator of the vitamin D status in dairy cows, and its dependence on sunlight exposure and dietary vitamin D supplementation. In this part also the “free hormone hypothesis” is discussed, indicating that the concentration of free 25(OH)D might be a more valid indicator of the vitamin D status than the concentration of total 25(OH)D. The third part deals with classical and the non-classical functions of vitamin D. Among the non-classical functions which are based on an autocrine vitamin D signalling, particular reference is given to the effects of vitamin D and vitamin D metabolites on the immune system in bovine immune cells and in dairy cows. Recent findings provide some indication that vitamin D or its metabolite 25(OH)D could enhance the immune function in dairy cows and be useful for the prevention and therapy of mastitis. However, the number of studies reported so far in this respect is very limited. Thus, much more research is required to yield clear concepts for an optimised usage of vitamin D to improve the immune system and prevent infectious diseases in dairy cows.
