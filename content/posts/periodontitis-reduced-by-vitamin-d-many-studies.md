#### Association of Vitamin D level and periodontitis: a comprehensive review - Dec 2024

Periodontal and Implant Research Volume 8, article number 14, (2024)

Tin Crnić & Adrian Kašaj 

Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease **affecting approximately 40% of the human population** , resulting from the immune response to microbial infections in periodontal tissues. While inflammation serves to protect against pathogens, it also leads to tissue damage and is associated with various systemic diseases. Risk factors include diabetes, smoking, and stress, with increasing evidence linking periodontitis to Vitamin D deficiency, which impacts over one billion people worldwide. Vitamin D is essential for maintaining bone health and supporting immune function, and its deficiency has been shown to adversely affect periodontal health. 

Adequate Vitamin D levels are crucial for effective management of periodontitis, as inflammation can lead to decreased 25(OH)D levels. 

Recent advancements in point-of-care technology now allows for rapid chairside testing of Vitamin D, significantly enhancing diagnostic efficiency in dental practices. Research indicates that Vitamin D plays a significant role in modulating immune responses, particularly by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Patients with periodontitis often exhibit lower Vitamin D levels, and supplementation has been shown to improve clinical outcomes, such as clinical attachment level (CAL) and bleeding index (BI). 

Thus, the use of adjunctive Vitamin D during non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) may enhance treatment effectiveness, although further longitudinal studies are needed to determine optimal dosages and long-term effects. 

In conclusion, maintaining adequate Vitamin D levels may offer protective benefits against the progression of periodontitis.

#### 3% less likely to get Peridontitis for every 1 ng more vitamin D - April 2021

 **Association between Periodontitis and Vitamin D Status: A case-control study** 

Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.04.006

Vitamin D deficiency and periodontitis are commonly prevalent among Saudi adults. However, the association between periodontitis and vitamin D status has not been well documented. This study aims to examine the association between periodontitis and vitamin D status among adults in the Albaha region of Saudi Arabia. A case-control study of 123 Saudi adults was conducted; 60 had severe or moderate periodontitis, and 63 were periodontally healthy. Data was collected by an online self-reported sociodemographic questionnaire. All participants then underwent a full periodontal examination. Blood samples were also provided to assess participants’ vitamin D statuses through serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). A total of 60 cases and 63 controls matched for BMI (30.2 ± 4.86 kg/m2), age (40.01 ± 7.73 years), and sex (46.3% and 53.7% male and female, respectively) participated in the study. Mean levels of 25(OH)D were significantly lower in periodontitis participants than in controls (25.03 ± 8.55 ng/ml, 29.19 ± 12.82 ng/ml, p = 0.037, respectively).

Lower odds of periodontitis were detected per unit of 25(OH)D level (OR 0.964, 95% CI; 0.931-0.999, p = 0.043). In conclusion, periodontitis is significantly associated with deficient and insufficient levels of vitamin D among Saudi adults in the Albaha region. Future longitudinal research with a larger sample size may be suggested to confirm these results.

#### Risk of COVID-19 death 8X more likely if have peridontitis - Feb 2021

 **[NEW STUDY LINKS PERIODONTITIS AND COVID‐19 COMPLICATIONS](https://www.perio.org/periodontitis_COVID-19_complications)** 

"...After adjusting for potential confounders, periodontitis was associated with COVID‐19 complication including

* death (OR = 8.81, 95% CI 1.00–77.7),

* ICU admission (OR = 3.54, 95% CI 1.39–9.05) and

* need for assisted ventilation (OR = 4.57, 95% CI 1.19–17.4)."

#### Vitamin D and Periodontitis (no conclusion) - meta-analysis Aug 2020

Vitamin D and Periodontitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

Nutrients [doi: 10.3390/nu12082177](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12082177)

Vanessa Machado,1,2,*† Sofia Lobo,1,† Luís Proença,3 José João Mendes,2 and João Botelho1,2

To explore the vitamin D levels of periodontitis patients in comparison with periodontally healthy ones, and to assess the influence of vitamin D supplementation as an adjunctive during nonsurgical periodontal treatment (NSPT). Five databases (Pubmed, Embase, Scholar, Web of Sciences, and Cochrane Library) were searched until May 2020. Mean difference (MD) meta-analysis with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and sensitivity tests via meta-regression were used. We followed Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) to appraise the strength and quality of the evidence. Sixteen articles were included, fourteen case-control and two intervention studies, all reporting 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels. Compared with the healthy controls, the circulating 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in chronic periodontitis patients (pooled MD = −6.80, 95% CI: −10.59 to −3.02). Subgroup analysis revealed differences among 25(OH)D measurements, with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry being the most homogeneous method (pooled MD = −2.05, 95% CI: −3.40 to −0.71). Salivary levels of 25(OH)D showed no differences between groups. Due to the low number of studies, conclusions on aggressive periodontitis and in the effect of vitamin D supplementation after NSPT were not possible to ascribe. Compared with healthy controls, 25(OH)D serum levels are significantly lower in chronic periodontitis patients, with an overall SORT A recommendation. Future studies are needed to clarify the effect of vitamin D supplementation and the biological mechanisms linking vitamin D to the periodontium.

#### What are some of the diseases linked to periodontitis - Asked Perplexity AI March 2024

Periodontitis has been linked to a variety of systemic diseases, as indicated by multiple studies. The diseases associated with periodontitis include:

*  **Diabetes** : Individuals with diabetes are more likely to have periodontal disease, and periodontal disease may make it more difficult for those with diabetes to control their blood sugar, potentially increasing the risk for diabetic complications

*  **Heart Disease** : Research suggests that periodontal disease may increase the risk of heart disease, possibly due to inflammation caused by periodontal disease. It can also exacerbate existing heart conditions

*  **Respiratory Disease** : Bacteria from periodontal disease can be aspirated into the lungs, contributing to respiratory diseases such as pneumonia. Periodontitis has also been linked with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), although evidence for a direct link remains preliminary.

*  **Cancer** : Studies have found that men with gum disease were more likely to develop kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, and blood cancers

*  **Alzheimer’s Disease** : There is evidence suggesting a connection between the bacteria associated with periodontal disease and the progression of Alzheimer’s disease

>  **Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes** : Periodontitis is related to maternal infection, preterm birth, low birth weight, and preeclampsia

*  **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** : CKD has been associated with periodontitis in several studies, though the complex pathogenesis of CKD and its close linkage with other conditions like diabetes makes it difficult to establish a direct link

*  **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)** : Early studies reported an association between periodontitis and RA, but current evidence for periodontitis as a risk factor for developing RA is limited

*  **Cognitive Impairment** : There is limited evidence from current studies for an association between periodontitis and cognitive impairment, which can precede dementia of the Alzheimer's disease type

*  **Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome** : While obesity is associated with an increased risk of periodontitis, the evidence for a direct link between periodontitis and metabolic syndrome is not well-established

These associations are not necessarily causal, but they do suggest that periodontal disease may contribute to the progression or severity of these systemic conditions. The mechanisms underlying these associations are complex and involve both direct effects of oral pathogens and indirect effects related to inflammation and immune responses
