### Sunny Holidays before and after Melanoma Diagnosis Are Respectively Associated with Lower Breslow Thickness and Lower Relapse Rates in Italy.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported an association between sun exposure and improved cutaneous melanoma (CM) survival. We analysed the association of UV exposure with prognostic factors and outcome in a large melanoma cohort.

METHODS: A questionnaire was given to 289 (42%) CM patients at diagnosis (Group 1) and to 402 CM patients (58%) during follow-up (Group 2). Analyses were carried out to investigate the associations between sun exposure and melanoma prognostic factors and survival.

RESULTS: Holidays in the sun two years before CM diagnosis were significantly associated with lower Breslow thickness (p=0.003), after multiple adjustment.

Number of weeks of sunny holidays was also significantly and inversely associated with thickness in a dose-dependent manner (p=0.007). 

However when stratifying by gender this association was found only among women (p=0.0004) the risk of CM recurrence in both sexes was significantly lower in patients (n=271) who had holidays in the sun after diagnosis, after multiple adjustment including education: HR=0.30 (95%CI:0.10-0.87; p=0.03) 

CONCLUSIONS: Holidays in the sun were associated with thinner melanomas in women and reduced rates of relapse in both sexes. 

However, these results do not prove a direct causal effect of sun exposure on survival since other confounding factors, such as vitamin D serum levels and socio-economic status, may play a role. 

Other factors in sun seeking individuals may also possibly affect these results.

#### Fewer with thick melanoma (>4 mm) if vacation

#### Help women especially

## Possible reasons include

1. Vitamin D from the sun provided reduced cancer (probably internal as well as external cancer)

> Can also get vitamin D from supplements

1. Less likely to have sunburn on a sunny vacation than on a sunny weekend
