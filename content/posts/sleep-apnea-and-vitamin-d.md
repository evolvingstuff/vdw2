### Hypothesis by Dr. Gominak in Texas: Sleep problems and Sleep Apnea are due to a lack of vitamins D3 and B12

#### Update by Dr, Gominak Nov 2011 [Poor sleep and lack of vitamin D - Nov 2011](/posts/poor-sleep-and-lack-of-vitamin-d)

### She recommends a vitamin D level of  70-85 ng/ml, with daily dose of 10,000 IU vitamin D (weekly not work as well)

 **Here are links to her video, a few of the slides, and the PDF** 

## Comment by a person who has seen both:

"The video does not compare to the PDF.  The PDF lacks all her passion and ALL her medical practice examples."

## Dr. Gominak video (in 5 parts) on Sleep and Vitamin D Nov 2010?

Pt. 1, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDqxJCzyV0U

Pt. 2, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYZRXs_vyP8

Pt. 3, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEECHr9WQY

Pt. 5, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8Jde_4ZK8M

## Rough notes from the video

### Part 3

* Air conditioning is one of the reasons we are vitamin D deficient

* Cholesterol connection

* Have to sleep better before the vitamin D can help the repair function during sleep

* FDA should not be in charge of vitamin D – it is a hormone, not a vitamin

### Part 5

* D2 50,000 (not D3) caused sleep problems

* Magnesium – leg cramps

* Leg pain, back pain

* She has a web site : http://drgominak.com/vitamin-d
