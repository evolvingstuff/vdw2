#### Quick summary: Calcium 500 mg total and Magnesium 100 mg when Vitamin D > 3000 IU

*  **<span style="color:#00F;">Note: 100 milligram of the Magnesium ELEMENT, not the COMPOUND</span>** 

* [CLICK HERE](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/16932-bioavailability-elemental-of-magnesium-types/) for a table to Magnesium content and bioavailablity 

#### Many studies have seem problems when vitamin D levels were increased without balancing the cofactor levels

#### Cofactors should be adjusted when taking more than 2,000 to 4,000 IU of vitamin D

The Magnesium deficiency shows up as pain within days in fewer than 1 in 30 people. 

The excess Calcium does not show up as a problem (for your cardiovascular system, inner ear, etc.) for years. 

#### Calcium Controversy: Is > 500 mg is too much or is  <1000 mg is OK

Most people already get enough Calcium in the diet and supplements. In fact too much Calcium if they take a lot of vitamin D

Increasing your vitamin D level may increase the bio-availability of Calcium about 3X

Excess Calcium apparently can be <a href="/posts/first-detected-in-the-urine" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1686">first detected in the urine</a>

Excess Calcium can cause such problems in the long term such as <a href="/posts/hardening-of-the-arteries" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1725">hardening of the arteries</a> and [Kidney Stones](%20[https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=81&sort_mode=created_desc) 

 **Most likely women who are pregnant or nursing need a bit more Calcium.**  

750 mg appears the be the right amount when taking lots of vitamin D when pregnant/breastfeeding

### <a href="/posts/vitamin-k2" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 765">Vitamin K2</a>  controls where Calcium is deposited in the body

Perhaps the controversey about how much Calcium to have is due to:

1. Studies lasting a year or less cannot notice the build-up of Calcium

1. Studies did not measure/control for Vitamin K2

### Magnesium

Most people are getting too little Magnesium, even before increasing their vitamin D levels.

There is a strong inter-relationships between Magnesium and Vitamin D

It appears that various people get a "toxic reaction" when they increase vitamin D while they have low levels of Magnesium

Reminder: Magnesium is consumed by vitamin D in both building bones and dealing with diseases

### This conceptual graph shows a guess about two cofactors

### News item April 2013 - Albion has 2 Mg to 1 Calcium veggie capsule:

First company which we are aware of that has gotten the right ratio.

114 mg Mg from Mg glucinate chelate, 67 mg Ca from Ca glucinate chelate, Vitamin D3 667 IU, 17 ug Vitamin K-2 (MK-7 form)

Pretty small amounts but nice combination. They recommend 1 pill 3 times a day

Which would be 340 Mg, 200 Ca, 2000 IU Vitamin D, 51 K-2

Swanson Vitamins has 90 capsules for $10  = 1 month at 3 pills per day
