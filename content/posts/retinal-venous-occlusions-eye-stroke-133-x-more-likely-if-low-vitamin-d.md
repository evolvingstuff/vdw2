PURPOSE:

To estimate serum vitamin D (25 OH D) level in patients of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and compare it with age-matched controls.

METHODS AND MATERIAL:

Forty patients above 18 years of age with retinal vein occlusion and forty age-matched controls underwent serum vitamin D (Vit D) level estimation using a standard protocol. Student's t test was used to analyse differences between the mean of two groups.

RESULTS:

The mean age in RVO and control group was 60.25 and 60.73 years respectively. The mean (±SD) level of vitamin D in RVO patients was 13.68 (±4.58) ng/mL (range 5.5-24.8), and the 95% CI of mean was 12.21-15.14 with SD 4.58 while in control group it was 23.03 (±2.89) ng/ml (range 18.4-30.1) with 95% CI of mean being 22.11-23.96 with SD 2.89 (p value of <0.005). While comparing the level of Vitamin D based on type of occlusion the mean level of Vit D in CRVO patients was 15.36 (SD 5.30) and in BRVO it was 12.77 (SD 3.96) which was statistically not significant (p = 0.08).  **The odds ratio calculated for RVO cases versus controls was 133.33**  which was statistically significant (P < 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS:

There is a paucity of published literature on level of Vit D in RVO. This study shows significantly lower levels of serum vitamin D in Indian patients with retinal vein occlusion as compared to age matched controls. Establishment of this correlation has possible implications for prophylaxis or treatment of RVOs.
