#### Adult osteomalacia, A treatable cause of "fear of falling"

The left hand x-ray suggested the diagnosis of osteomalacia because of the diffuse demineralization.{Image in PDF}

A 65-year-old man was hospitalized with a gait disorder, obliging him to shuffle laterally1 (video on the Neurology® Web site at www.neurology.org) because of pain and proximal limb weakness. 

He had a  **gastrectomy**  for cancer 7 years previously, with  **severe vitamin D deficiency** ; parathormone and alkaline phosphatase were increased, with reduced serum and urine calcium and phosphate. 

There was reduced bone density (figure). He was mildly hypothyroid and pancytopenia B12 and folate levels were normal. Investigation for an endocrine neoplasm (CT scan, Octreoscan) was negative. 

EMG of proximal muscles was typical for chronic myopathy; nerve conduction studies had normal results.

After 80 days' supplementation with calcium,  **vitamin D** , and levothyroxine, the patient walked properly without assistance (video); pancytopenia and alkaline phosphatase improved.
