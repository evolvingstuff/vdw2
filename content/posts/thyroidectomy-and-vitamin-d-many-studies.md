Thyroid neoplasms (tumors) are the most common pathology of the endocrine system that requires surgery, and in most cases changes are benign. The surgical treatment of thyroid neoplasms consists in total, subtotal, or one lobe excision. Our study aimed to assess the concentration of vitamin D and its metabolites in patients before thyroidectomy. The study included 167 patients with thyroid pathology. Before the thyroidectomy procedure calcidiol (25-OHD), calcitriol (1,25-(OH)2D), and vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), as well as basic biochemical parameters, were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Data analysis showed that the cohort of patients has a significant 25-OHD deficiency and proper concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D. 

Before the surgery, more than 80% of patients have extreme vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng/mL), and only 4% of the study group has proper 25-OHD concentration. Patients undergoing thyroidectomy are exposed to many complications, including calcium reduction. Our research has shown that patients prior to surgery have a marked vitamin D deficiency, an indicator that may affect their subsequent convalescence and prognosis. The results suggest that determination of vitamin D levels prior to thyroidectomy may be useful for potential consideration of supplementation when vitamin D deficiency is marked and needs to be incorporated into the good clinical management of these patients.
