### A staggering body of evidence and study points to vitamin D as a better flu deterrent than a flu shot.

### Greatly reduce your chance of getting the flu by taking just one vitamin D capsule twice a month

Buy a bottle of  **50,000 IU of vitamin D3**  capsules and mark your calendar to take  **one every second week**    

On the assigned day take your sunshine in a capsule and then mark it off.

If you forget to look at your calendar for a few days, you can take the capsule days later.
