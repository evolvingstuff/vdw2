Yes, vitamin D does go through the lymphatic system before entering the bloodstream. When vitamin D is ingested, it is absorbed in the small intestines and binds to chylomicrons, which are lipoprotein particles that transport lipids from the gut. These chylomicrons, carrying vitamin D, enter the lymphatic system and then the bloodstream before being transferred to the liver for further metabolism 4. 

In the liver, vitamin D is hydroxylated to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), which is the principal circulating form of vitamin D 1.

#### Note: Most studies show gut vitamin d going directly into the blood

 **The lymph system works very slowly, thus the day-long delay in getting oral Vitamin D into the liver**
