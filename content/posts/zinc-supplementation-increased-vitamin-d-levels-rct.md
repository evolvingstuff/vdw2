Too curious. so I purchased the PDF, ( but I cannot post it on the web)

Yes indeed, fewer postmenopausal women were vitamin D deficient after getting Zinc for 8 weeks

&nbsp; &nbsp; 75% ==> 55%

But, strangely, the average Vitamin D levels also went up in the older women in the placebo group.

&nbsp; &nbsp; 17 ng ==> 20 ng,   and did not change for the younger women ( 20 ng ==> 20 ng)

 **It has been well known that increasing Zinc consumption can increase the amount of Vitamin D in the blood which actually gets to the cells (by increasing activation of the Vitamin D Receptor** 

 **I am unaware of any other report which also found an increase in blood levels of vitamin D** 

 **I found, however, that increasing Zinc [treats liver cirrhosis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26626635/), which might allow the liver to put more vitamin D into the blood**
