Purpose:Vitamin D3 is a secosteroid mainly synthesized from the conversion of the skin precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 by ultraviolet (UV) B sunlight.  **Extra-renal synthesis of vitamin D3 has been reported in many tissues and cells including barrier sites** . This study characterizes the expression of components of vitamin D signaling in human ocular barrier cells. 

Methods:Human conjunctival epithelial (CCL20.2), human corneal endothelial (HCEC-12), non-pigmented ciliary body epithelial (ODM-2), and adult retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cell lines and primary human scleral fibroblasts (HSF), were analyzed for the expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR), the vitamin D activating enzymes 1Î±-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), 25-hydroxylases (CYP27A1 and CYP2R1), the vitamin D inactivating enzyme 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1), and endocytic receptors cubulin and megalin utilizing a combination of RT-PCR, Immunocytochemistry and EIA. 

Results:CCL20.2, HSF, HCEC-12, ODM-2, and ARPE-19 express mRNA and protein for all vitamin D synthesizing and metabolizing components. The cell types tested except HSF are able to convert inactive 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) into active 1,25-hydroxyviatmin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) in the order of HCEC-12>ODM2>CCL20.2>ARPE >HSF. 

Conclusions: This novel study demonstrates that ocular barrier epithelial cells express the machinery for vitamin D3 and can produce 1,25(OH)2D3. We suggest that vitamin D3 might play a role in immune regulation and barrier function in ocular barrier cells.
