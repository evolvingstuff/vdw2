#### Milk used to provide enough Vitamin D for US children

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  **But no longer** 

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Less Vitamin D from the sun</span>** 

1) Fewer children are outdoors 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; air conditioning. pollution, fear of skin cancer, indoor media, security concerns

2) More children are dark-skinned

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Less Vitamin D in food</span>** 

3) Very few children now get full-fat milk 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.5X less Vitamin D obtained from low-fat milk

4) Less Vitamin D from fish and meat – aquatic and land-based factory farms

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Less activated Vitamin D in blood</span>** 

5) Decreased Magnesium in the diet – Mg used in 8 places to activate Vitamin D

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also - increased sugar in the diet decreases Mg absorption and increases Mg excretion

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even less Mg in the body if the sugar is high-fructose corn syrup

6) Increase unsaturated fats in the diet

7) Increased salt in processed foods (which reduces Magnesium)

8) Less cholesterol in the diet (to make vitamin D from the sun)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Now Need More Vitamin D</span>** 

9) More children are now obese – so will need more Vitamin D

10) 30% of children today suffer with chronic disease 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which consume Vitamin D and/or decrease bio-availability
