Getting enough magnesium provides a wide range of benefits, including:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bone Health:</strong> Magnesium helps regulate calcium and vitamin D, playing a critical role in bone formation. Adequate magnesium intake is linked to better bone density and a lower risk of osteoporosis​</p></li><li><p><strong>Heart Health:</strong> Sufficient magnesium supports normal blood pressure and heart rhythm. In fact, diets rich in magnesium may <strong>reduce the risk of high blood pressure</strong> – the FDA now allows a qualified health claim acknowledging this link (though evidence is not conclusive)​.</p><ul><li>Magnesium is also used to treat certain heart arrhythmias (like the dangerous rhythm torsades de pointes) and may help prevent complications like stroke​</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Metabolic Health:</strong> Higher magnesium intake is associated with improved insulin sensitivity and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Obtaining ample magnesium (particularly from food sources) can help reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome and diabetes in middle-aged adults​</p></li><li><p><strong>Women&rsquo;s Health:</strong> Magnesium can alleviate <strong>premenstrual syndrome (PMS)</strong> symptoms and has been used in pregnancy to manage <strong>pre-eclampsia/eclampsia</strong> (dangerously high blood pressure in pregnancy)​.</p></li></ul><p>Ensuring adequate magnesium may also benefit menopausal women; for example, magnesium supplements have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes in breast cancer survivors​</p><ul><li><p><strong>Digestive Health:</strong> Certain magnesium compounds serve as <strong>antacids and laxatives</strong> . Magnesium hydroxide (milk of magnesia) can neutralize stomach acid to relieve heartburn, and magnesium’s osmotic effect in the gut makes it an effective remedy for constipation​</p></li><li><p><strong>Mental and Nervous System Support:</strong> Magnesium plays a key role in brain and nervous system function. Low magnesium is associated with mood disorders like <strong>anxiety and depression</strong> , and increasing magnesium can help reduce stress and improve mood in deficient individuals​.</p><ul><li>It also has a calming effect on the nervous system, often improving <strong>sleep quality</strong> (magnesium can help with insomnia)​.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In clinical settings, magnesium (often given intravenously) has shown effectiveness in reducing <strong>migraines and headaches</strong> ​</p><p>, and it may even aid in relieving symptoms of <strong>restless leg syndrome</strong> and muscle cramps by relaxing muscles​</p><ul><li>(Note: Many of magnesium’s benefits overlap with those of vitamin D. A VitaminDWiki analysis points out that the same key benefits attributed to magnesium – such as improved bone strength, blood pressure control, and reduced risk of diabetes – are also observed with adequate vitamin D, highlighting their interrelated roles​</li></ul><p><strong><span style=color:#00f>Symptoms of Magnesium Deficiency</span></strong></p><p>Magnesium deficiency is <strong>common</strong> – it’s estimated that a majority of people do not meet the minimum daily magnesium requirements​.</p><p>A lack of magnesium can produce a wide range of symptoms, since this mineral affects nearly every system in the body. <strong>Common signs of magnesium deficiency include:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Muscle problems:</strong> muscle cramps, spasms or twitches, and general muscle aches​</p></li><li><p><strong>Fatigue and sleep disturbances:</strong> low energy, weakness, and <strong>insomnia</strong> (trouble sleeping) are frequently reported when magnesium is low​</p></li><li><p><strong>Mood and neurological issues:</strong> irritability, <strong>anxiety</strong> , and <strong>depression</strong> can arise or worsen with magnesium deficiency, sometimes accompanied by confusion or poor memory​.</p><ul><li>In severe cases, nerve-related symptoms like numbness, tingling, or even <strong>seizures</strong> may occur​</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Heart and circulatory symptoms:</strong> <strong>high blood pressure</strong> , heart palpitations, or abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) can be linked to low magnesium​.</p><ul><li>Magnesium deficiency is also known to cause <strong>low potassium levels</strong> (since magnesium is needed to maintain potassium balance), which can further lead to heart rhythm issues​</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Bone and metabolic issues:</strong> chronically low magnesium may contribute to <strong>osteoporosis</strong> (weakened bones) over time and is associated with an increased risk of <strong>type 2 diabetes</strong> ​</p></li></ul><p>Because these symptoms are broad and can overlap with other conditions, magnesium deficiency is often overlooked. Notably, many symptoms of vitamin D deficiency are similar to those of magnesium deficiency, and this is no coincidence – the two nutrients depend on each other (more on that in <strong>Interactions</strong> below)​.</p><p>If someone has persistently low vitamin D levels or symptoms despite supplementation, an underlying magnesium shortage might be a contributing factor​</p><p><strong><span style=color:#00f>Recommended Dosage and Intake</span></strong></p><p><strong>Daily Requirements:</strong> For adults, health guidelines generally recommend a magnesium intake on the order of a few hundred milligrams per day (around <strong>300–420 mg of elemental magnesium</strong> for most adults, depending on sex and life stage). This roughly corresponds to the official RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowance) values, though some experts believe the RDA is set too low​.</p><p>In practice, many people do not reach even the minimum recommended intake through diet alone​.</p><p>For instance, leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains are rich in magnesium, yet modern diets high in processed foods tend to be magnesium-poor. Historical data suggests that a century ago people commonly consumed about <strong>500 mg of magnesium per day</strong> , whereas today the average is closer to <strong>200 mg</strong> , reflecting decreased magnesium in our food supply​.</p><p>Because of this gap, some nutrition experts advise aiming for <strong>150% of the current RDA</strong> for a period of time to “replenish” the body’s magnesium stores, then continuing with a maintenance dose thereafter​.</p><p>In practical terms, this means many adults may benefit from about <strong>400–600 mg of magnesium daily</strong> (from all sources combined) to ensure optimal levels​</p><p><strong>Supplementation Guidelines:</strong> When diet isn’t providing enough, magnesium supplements are used to fill the gap. A typical supplemental dose ranges from <strong>100 mg up to ~400 mg per day</strong> of elemental magnesium (note: “elemental” magnesium refers to the actual magnesium content, excluding the weight of whatever compound it’s bound to)​.</p><p>The exact amount can be adjusted based on individual needs and tolerances – for example, someone with a significant deficiency might take the higher end (300–400 mg) in supplements, whereas someone getting moderate magnesium from food might take a smaller dose around 100–200 mg. <strong>It’s often recommended to split the daily magnesium dose into two smaller doses (e.g. morning and evening)</strong> rather than one large dose​.</p><p>Splitting doses improves absorption and helps avoid gastrointestinal side effects. Magnesium in large amounts has a natural laxative effect; many people find that taking more than about <strong>300–400 mg at once</strong> can cause loose stools or diarrhea​.</p><p>By dividing the dose (for instance, 200 mg twice a day), the intestines can absorb more effectively and the risk of a sudden laxative effect is reduced​</p><p><strong>Upper Limits and Safety:</strong> Magnesium from food is not known to cause harm, but with supplements there is a caution not to overdo it. The <strong>tolerable upper intake level (UL)</strong> for supplemental magnesium is set at <strong>350 mg per day</strong> for adults​.</p><p>This UL only applies to <strong>magnesium from supplements or medications</strong> , not magnesium naturally present in foods​.</p><p>The 350 mg guideline is mainly to prevent diarrhea and mild adverse effects in the general population. In practice, many individuals can safely take more than 350 mg/day in supplements if needed for deficiency, <strong>provided it’s done gradually and under guidance</strong> , but exceeding the UL isn’t advisable unless there&rsquo;s a clear medical reason. It’s important to listen to one’s body – the appearance of diarrhea is a sign to reduce the dose. People with normal kidney function readily excrete excess magnesium, so toxicity is rare; however, those with kidney disease must be much more careful (see <strong>Additional Details – Safety</strong> ).</p><p><strong>Choosing a Magnesium Form:</strong> The form of magnesium supplement can make a big difference in effectiveness and tolerance (see <strong>Additional Details – Supplement Forms</strong> for more on this). For example, magnesium oxide pills contain a lot of magnesium by weight but are <strong>poorly absorbed</strong> – studies and consensus indicate magnesium oxide has very low bioavailability (not much better than a placebo)​.</p><p>In contrast, organic forms like magnesium citrate or magnesium chloride are <strong>much better absorbed</strong> by the body​.</p><ul><li><p>Magnesium citrate is a popular choice for oral supplements; it’s fairly well absorbed, though it can cause looser stools in some people (more so than other forms)​.</p></li><li><p>Magnesium chloride is another excellent form – it’s available in liquids or flakes and not only absorbs well orally, but can also be used <strong>topically</strong> (applied on the skin) to help with muscle soreness​.</p></li></ul><p>When choosing a supplement, it’s also recommended to <strong>avoid products that combine calcium and magnesium</strong> in one pill​.</p><p>Many people already get plenty of calcium, and taking high-dose calcium together with magnesium can reduce magnesium’s effectiveness or absorption; moreover, an excessive calcium intake relative to magnesium can be counterproductive (as explained below)​.</p><p>For most adults focusing on magnesium, a standalone magnesium supplement (without added calcium) is preferable​</p><p><strong><span style=color:#00f>Interactions with Vitamin D and Other Nutrients</span></strong></p><p>One of the most important interactions of magnesium is with <strong>vitamin D</strong> . Magnesium and vitamin D work <strong>hand-in-hand</strong> , and each depends on the other to maximize its benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Magnesium activates vitamin D:</strong> Magnesium is a required co-factor in the enzymatic reactions that convert vitamin D into its active form (calcitriol). There are multiple steps in the liver and kidneys to metabolize vitamin D, and magnesium is needed at <strong>no fewer than 8 steps in that process</strong> ​.</li></ul><p>If magnesium levels are low, vitamin D may not be properly activated to do its job in the body. In effect, a magnesium deficiency can induce a state of “vitamin D resistance,” where even if you have adequate vitamin D intake, it isn’t fully effective​.</p><p>This is why some people who take high doses of vitamin D but feel no improvement might actually be lacking magnesium. Ensuring sufficient magnesium can “unlock” vitamin D’s benefits.</p><ul><li><strong>Vitamin D consumes magnesium:</strong> The relationship is a two-way street – while magnesium is needed for vitamin D activity, raising vitamin D levels also <strong>uses up magnesium</strong> . There are at least two ways this happens. First, vitamin D increases calcium absorption and bone formation; when vitamin D helps deposit calcium into bones, magnesium is drawn in as well because magnesium is an integral component of bone (bones contain a magnesium reserve)​.</li></ul><p>Second, all the enzymatic reactions mentioned above require magnesium as a co-factor, so when you take vitamin D, your body will consume magnesium to process it​.</p><p>People who start vitamin D supplements sometimes experience muscle cramps or other magnesium-deficiency symptoms – this can be because the sudden increase in vitamin D activity is depleting their borderline magnesium stores. <strong>In practice, taking vitamin D increases your magnesium requirement</strong> , so it’s wise to supplement magnesium alongside vitamin D​</p><ul><li><strong>Synergy and balance:</strong> Magnesium and vitamin D <strong>enhance each other’s effectiveness</strong> when present together​.</li></ul><p>Many experts advise that to <strong>get the full benefit of vitamin D, you must also ensure adequate magnesium</strong> , and vice versa​.</p><p>Studies have shown that correcting a magnesium deficiency can raise vitamin D levels in the blood (because the vitamin D is better metabolized), and similarly, having enough vitamin D can improve magnesium’s functions in the body. In short, <strong>magnesium and vitamin D are synergistic</strong> nutrients​.</p><p>This synergy is evident in their overlapping health effects – for example, magnesium and vitamin D both support bone health, immune function, and cardiovascular health, and deficiency in either is linked to similar issues. It’s even been observed that the vast majority of people are deficient in both simultaneously​.</p><p>For these reasons, when supplementing vitamin D, it’s often recommended to add magnesium (and other cofactors like vitamin K2) to avoid any bottleneck in the benefits.</p><p>Magnesium also interacts with <strong>other minerals</strong> and electrolytes, notably <strong>calcium</strong> and <strong>potassium</strong> . The ratio of calcium to magnesium in the diet is important. Traditionally, a 2:1 calcium-to-magnesium ratio is cited for bone health, but in modern diets the ratio is often much higher (meaning a lot of calcium and too little magnesium). <strong>High calcium with low magnesium can lead to problems</strong> : excess calcium can deposit where it shouldn’t (like in arteries or kidneys) and can trigger muscle tension, while magnesium is needed to relax muscles and balance calcium’s effects. An analysis on VitaminDWiki points out that populations or individuals with a <strong>very high Ca:Mg ratio have more heart disease</strong> , suggesting that too much calcium without enough magnesium stresses the cardiovascular system​.</p><p>In practical terms, this means if you are supplementing calcium or have a calcium-rich diet, it’s crucial to have sufficient magnesium to keep them in balance. This also explains the earlier point to avoid combined Ca-Mg supplement pills – you don’t want to tip the scales toward calcium when magnesium is the one most people lack​.</p><p>Instead, prioritize magnesium (unless a healthcare provider has advised you that you specifically need more calcium). Magnesium helps direct calcium to where it’s needed (bones and teeth) and prevents it from causing calcifications in soft tissues.</p><p>Magnesium works closely with <strong>potassium</strong> as well. Both magnesium and potassium are electrolytes that maintain normal heart rhythm and muscle function. When magnesium is low, it’s common to see low potassium levels too, because magnesium is required for potassium to enter cells and stay in balance. For example, one sign of magnesium deficiency is a secondary <strong>potassium deficiency</strong> , which can manifest as muscle weakness, cramps, and abnormal heart rhythms​.</p><p>If someone has low potassium that isn’t corrected by taking potassium, it’s often because magnesium is also low. Replenishing magnesium helps stabilize potassium levels, benefiting muscle and heart function​</p><p>Finally, certain <strong>medications and lifestyle factors</strong> interact with magnesium status. Diuretics (water pills), some chemotherapy drugs, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs used for acid reflux) are known to <strong>deplete magnesium</strong> over time​.</p><p>Alcohol abuse and high caffeine intake can also increase magnesium loss. People on such medications or with these risk factors should be vigilant about magnesium intake and may require supplementation. Conversely, magnesium can interact with a few medications by affecting their absorption – for instance, magnesium supplements can interfere with certain antibiotics or thyroid medications if taken at the same time, by binding to them in the gut. It’s generally recommended to <strong>space magnesium supplements a couple of hours apart from medications</strong> that have known interactions (one should consult a pharmacist or doctor for specific guidance). Overall, maintaining magnesium balance is a matter of managing both diet and these interactions so that magnesium isn’t unintentionally drained from your body.</p><p><strong><span style=color:#00f>Additional Considerations and Tips</span></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dietary Sources and Declining Magnesium in Foods:</strong> Magnesium is naturally present in many foods. Good dietary sources include dark leafy greens (such as spinach and kale), nuts and seeds (almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds), legumes, whole grains, and certain fruits like bananas and avocados. However, modern farming and food processing have significantly <strong>reduced the magnesium content of foods</strong> compared to a century ago​.</li></ul><p>Refining grains removes magnesium-rich parts of the grain, and many soils today are less mineral-rich. This contributes to the high prevalence of magnesium deficiency. Historical estimates cited on VitaminDWiki note that around <strong>1900, the average dietary magnesium intake was ~500 mg/day</strong> , but by the 1990s it had plummeted to ~200 mg/day​.</p><p>Additionally, the way we treat our water can remove magnesium – for example, softening water or using reverse osmosis filtration <strong>eliminates magnesium from drinking water</strong> (along with other minerals)​.</p><p>If your diet is low in produce and high in processed foods, or if you drink only distilled/RO water, you may be getting very little magnesium from these sources. Increasing magnesium-rich whole foods and considering mineral drops for filtered water are ways to improve dietary magnesium intake.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Supplement Forms and Absorption:</strong> Magnesium supplements come in a variety of <strong>forms</strong> , and choosing the right form can impact how well it works for you. Some common forms include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Magnesium citrate:</strong> A popular form for supplementation; it is relatively well-absorbed and often used to address constipation as well (due to a mild laxative effect). It usually comes in capsules or powder.</p></li><li><p><strong>Magnesium chloride:</strong> Known for its high bioavailability, magnesium chloride can be taken in liquid form or as magnesium oil applied to the skin. It tends to have a lower laxative effect for a given amount of elemental magnesium, making it gentler on the gut​.</p><ul><li>Magnesium chloride is also the form found in <strong>magnesium flakes</strong> for foot soaks or baths, used to soothe muscles.)</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Magnesium oxide:</strong> A very common, inexpensive form found in many basic supplements, but <strong>not well absorbed</strong> . Magnesium oxide provides a lot of magnesium by weight, but the body can only uptake a small fraction of it, so it may act mostly as a laxative and is considered one of the least effective choices for raising magnesium levels​</p></li><li><p><strong>Other forms:</strong> There are many other magnesium compounds available, such as magnesium glycinate (magnesium bound to the amino acid glycine), magnesium malate, magnesium taurate, and magnesium threonate. These were not detailed on the VitaminDWiki page, but in general these forms are designed to improve absorption or target specific issues (for example, magnesium glycinate is known for being easy on the stomach and helpful for anxiety/sleep, while magnesium threonate has been studied for cognitive benefits). All forms ultimately provide magnesium, but if one form causes GI upset, another form might be better tolerated. It may be worth experimenting or consulting nutrition resources to find the form that suits your needs.In addition to oral supplements, <strong>transdermal magnesium</strong> is an option. This includes products like <strong>magnesium oil or gel</strong> (often magnesium chloride) that you rub on the skin, or Epsom salt baths ( <strong>magnesium sulfate</strong> in bath water). Transdermal absorption bypasses the digestive system, so it can be useful for people who get diarrhea from oral supplements. Some individuals report good results for muscle relaxation and cramps with magnesium baths or oil. While transdermal absorption rates can vary, these methods are generally safe to try alongside dietary intake. Another novel form mentioned is <strong>“angstrom” or ionic magnesium</strong> , which refers to very small magnesium particles in a liquid suspension that can be taken sublingually (under the tongue)​.</p></li><li><p>This form is claimed to be absorbed directly into cells with minimal laxative effect, though it tends to be more expensive.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Safety and Precautions:</strong> Magnesium is <strong>considered safe for most people</strong> , as the kidneys will excrete excess magnesium efficiently in those with normal renal function. There is essentially no risk of getting too much magnesium from food alone. Even with supplements, magnesium toxicity (hypermagnesemia) is rare and typically only occurs if the <strong>kidneys are not working properly</strong> (or in extreme overdose situations). That said, there are a few precautions to note. Individuals with <strong>severely impaired kidney function</strong> (e.g. end-stage kidney disease on dialysis) should <strong>not take magnesium supplements unless under medical supervision</strong> ​.</p><p>When the kidneys can’t clear magnesium, it can accumulate and cause serious issues (such as slowed heart rate or muscle weakness). Likewise, people with <strong>Myasthenia Gravis</strong> (a neuromuscular disorder) are usually advised to avoid extra magnesium, since it can worsen muscle weakness in that condition​.</p><p>Magnesium can also slow the heart rate, so if someone has a medical condition characterized by an abnormally slow heart rate or an AV block, high-dose magnesium should be used cautiously​.</p><p>Apart from these specific contraindications, the main side effect to watch for is the aforementioned diarrhea or loose stools at higher doses. If you experience this, simply reduce the dosage or switch forms. Signs of <strong>magnesium overdose</strong> (which are very uncommon from oral intake) might include lethargy, confusion, extremely low blood pressure, or irregular heartbeat – these would require urgent medical attention. Again, this is exceedingly rare outside of people with kidney failure. Overall, magnesium supplements have an excellent safety profile when used responsibly.</p><ul><li><strong>Testing Magnesium Levels:</strong> Evaluating magnesium status isn’t as straightforward as testing something like blood sugar. Most of the body’s magnesium is stored in <strong>bones and inside cells</strong> , not in the blood serum. A standard <strong>serum magnesium test</strong> (part of many blood panels) can confirm severe deficiency, but it may appear normal even if your tissues are low on magnesium. For a more sensitive measure, some practitioners order a <strong>RBC magnesium test</strong> , which checks the magnesium content of red blood cells as a proxy for intracellular magnesium​.</li></ul><p>There are also magnesium loading tests and ionized magnesium tests, but these are less common. If you suspect magnesium deficiency and your serum levels are “normal,” it might be worth discussing further testing or simply doing a trial of magnesium supplementation (with medical guidance if needed) to see if symptoms improve. Since magnesium is safe and affordable, a practical approach for many is to ensure they meet intake recommendations and monitor how they feel.</p><p><strong>~~#F00:In summary, magnesium is a vital nutrient</strong> ~~ that supports numerous aspects of health, from strengthening bones to regulating mood and heart rhythm. It works in concert with vitamin D and other nutrients, so maintaining a good balance is key. Given the prevalence of magnesium deficiency and the potential benefits of correcting it, magnesium deserves attention in anyone’s nutrition and wellness plan. Whether through magnesium-rich foods or quality supplements (and often both), achieving adequate magnesium levels can lead to noticeable improvements in well-being – with better sleep, steadier mood, fewer cramps/headaches, and even improvements in blood pressure or blood sugar control. Magnesium truly is an unsung hero among minerals, and ensuring you get enough can pay dividends for your health</p><p>This summary is online at <a href=https://chatgpt.com/share/67c13037-12d0-8008-818d-f60b8e7e5ba4>https://chatgpt.com/share/67c13037-12d0-8008-818d-f60b8e7e5ba4</a></p><hr><h3 id=magnesium-by-itself-helps-with-various-healthproblems>Magnesium by itself helps with various health problems</h3><ul><li><a href=/posts/magnesium-matters-in-health-and-disease-review>Magnesium Matters in health and disease – Review Oct 2024</a></li></ul><h4 id=magnesium-and-hypertension---fda-allows-claim-as-of-jan2022>Magnesium and Hypertension - FDA allows claim as of Jan 2022</h4><p><strong><a href=https://www.fda.gov/food/cfsan-constituent-updates/fda-announces-qualified-health-claim-magnesium-and-reduced-risk-high-blood-pressure>FDA Announces Qualified Health Claim for Magnesium and Reduced Risk of High Blood Pressure</a></strong></p><p>The FDA responded to a health claim petition submitted on behalf of <a href=https://magnesiumeducation.com/>The Center for Magnesium Education and Research</a>, LLC. - and will now allow:</p><ul><li><p>“Inconsistent and inconclusive scientific evidence suggests that diets with adequate magnesium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure (hypertension), a condition associated with many factors.”</p></li><li><p>“Consuming diets with adequate magnesium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure (hypertension).

The magnesium content of foods is gradually decreasing due to food processing, and magnesium supplementation for healthy living has become increasingly popular. However, data is very limited on the bioavailability of various magnesium preparations. The aim of this study is to investigate the bioavailability of five different magnesium compounds (magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, magnesium acetyl taurate, magnesium citrate, and magnesium malate) in different tissues. Following a single dose of 400 mg/70 kg magnesium administration to Sprague Dawley rats, bioavailability was evaluated by examining time-dependent absorption, tissue penetration, and the effects on the behavior of the animals.</p><p>Pharmacokinetically, the area under the curve calculation is highest in the magnesium malate.</p><p>The magnesium acetyl taurate was found to have the second-highest area under the curve calculation. <strong>Magnesium acetyl taurate was rapidly absorbed, able to pass through to the brain easily, had the highest tissue concentration level in the brain, and was found to be associated with decreased anxiety indicators.</strong> Magnesium malate levels remained high for an extended period of time in the serum. The commonly prescribed dietary supplements magnesium oxide and magnesium citrate had the lowest bioavailability when compared to our control group. More research is needed to investigate the bioavailability of magnesium malate and acetyl taurate compounds and their effects on specific tissues and behavior.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/mg-speed-sci-hub.pdf>Download the PDF from Sci-Hub via VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=citrate-good-oxide-not-better-than-placebo---rct2003>Citrate good, Oxide not better than placebo - RCT 2003</h4><p><a href=http://www.jle.com/en/revues/mrh/e-docs/mg_citrate_found_more_bioavailable_than_other_mg_preparations_in_a_randomised_doubleblind_study__260858/article.phtml>Mg citrate found more bioavailable than other Mg preparations in a randomized, double-blind study</a></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/mg-bioavailability-2003.jpg alt=image width=800><p>Published data on the bioavailability of various Mg preparations is too fragmented and scanty to inform the proper choice of Mg preparation for clinical studies. In this study, the relative bioavailability of three preparations of Mg (amino-acid chelate, citrate, and oxide) was compared at a daily dose of 300 mg of elemental Mg in 46 healthy individuals. The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel intervention of 60 days duration. Urine, blood, and saliva samples were taken at baseline, 24 h after the first Mg supplement was taken (acute‘ supplementation), and after 60 days of daily Mg consumption (chronic‘ supplementation). Results showed that supplementation of the organic forms of Mg (citrate and amino-acid chelate) showed greater absorption (P ± 0.033) at 60 days than MgO, as assessed by the 24-h urinary Mg excretion. Mg citrate led to the greatest mean serum Mg concentration compared with other treatments following both acute (P ± 0.026) and chronic (P ± 0.006) supplementation. Furthermore, although mean erythrocyte Mg concentration showed no differences among groups, chronic Mg citrate supplementation resulted in the greatest (P ± 0.027) mean salivary Mg concentration compared with all other treatments. <strong>Mg oxide supplementation resulted in no differences compared to placebo</strong> . We conclude that daily supplementation with Mg citrate shows superior bioavailability after 60 days of treatment when compared with other treatments studied.</p><hr><h4 id=much-more-heart-disease-if-the-calciummagnesium-ratio-is-toohigh>Much more heart disease if the Calcium/Magnesium ratio is too high</h4><p><a href=http://george-eby-research.com/html/depression-anxiety.html>George Eby</a></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/camg-ratio-vs-heart-disease.jpg alt=image><hr><h4 id=magnesium-relateddiseases>Magnesium-related diseases</h4><p><strong>owned and funded by Paul Mason (<a href=/tags/mr-mason-summarized-the-who-conference.html>Mr. Mason summarized the WHO conference</a> in the book: Magnesium Miracle)</strong></p><p>For the science, this excellent (no longer updated 2022?) website shows the diseases and gives you an opportunity to review the many papers on magnesium: <a href=https://www.mgwater.com>www.mgwater.com</a></p><p>Diseases = Aging; Aggressive Behavior; Alcoholism; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease; Arrhythmia; Asthma; Attention Deficit Disorder; Autism; Cancer; Cerebral Palsy; Cerebrovascular; Chemical Sensitivity; Chronic Fatigue; Cluster Headaches; Cocaine-related Stroke; Constipation; Cramps; Diabetes; Fluoride Toxicity; Head Injuries, Central Nervous System Injuries; Heart Disease, Heart Attack, Atherosclerosis, Cardiovascular Disease, etc.; HIV, AIDS; Hypertension; Kidney Stones; Magnesium Deficiency; Menopause; Migraine Headache; Mitral Valve Prolapse; Multiple Sclerosis; Nystagmus; Osteoporosis; Peripheral vascular disease; Pregnancy-related problems, Eclampsia; Premenstrual Syndrome, PMS; Psychiatric Disorders; Repetitive Strain Injury; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Sickle Cell Disease; SIDS; Sports-related problems; Stress; Stuttering; Tetanus; Tinnitus, Sound Sensitivity; TMJ; Toxic Shock; Violence</p><hr><h3 id=magnesium-bioavailability>Magnesium Bioavailability</h3><h4 id=bioavailability-and-pharmacokinetics-of-magnesium--2001>Bioavailability and Pharmacokinetics of Magnesium - 2001</h4><p><strong>Bioavailability and Pharmacokinetics of Magnesium After Administration of Magnesium Salts to Humans</strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/bio-2001-t1a.jpg alt=image width=900>

This is why serum Ca++ is easy to determine (about 50% of that circulating is ionized). And that serum ionized component communicates with the parathyroid glands. Intracellular Ca++ is critical for the transmission of neuromuscular impulses but is immediately transported out of the cell afterward. On the other hand, only 1-2% of total magnesium is circulating, and less than 50% of that is ionized. This has only a very weak correlation with intracellular magnesium, 99% of which is bound, esp. to ADP and ATP. Mg++ is the only active form.</p><p>60-65% of Magnesium is in the bones Blood has only 1% of the Magnesium (vs 99% of the Calcium is in bones)</p><p><strong>Dead Soil</strong> Potash which has been used for fertilizer since the 1930s, is more easily taken up by plants than magnesium or calcium. There typically is Magnesium in soils that have been used/abused for a long time. It also is leached out by rainwater, especially from acid rains. If soil is determined to be too acidic, lime is typically added, which again reduces the Magnesium.</p><p><strong>Processed Food Lacks Magnesium</strong> Refining flour is 80% lost, and Polishing rice is 83% lost. Production of starch from corn 97% lost, Extraction of white sugar from molasses 99% lost</p><p><strong>Fluoridated Water Banishes Magnesium</strong> Fluoride binds magnesium, making it insoluble, and it makes bones brittle.</p><p><strong>Stomach Acid is Essential for Magnesium Absorption,</strong> A big problem for people such as the elderly who are deficient in stomach acid.</p><p><strong>Absorption of Dietary Magnesium Is Hindered.</strong> A healthy body nicely sluffs off any excess magnesium. Our body was not evolved to store magnesium as it had always been readily available in foods. Problems with magnesium absorption include diseased intestines, low parathyroid hormone, amount of calcium, phosphorus, potassium (wonder about vitamin D), sodium, lactose, and iron. If take iron, take hours apart from when take magnesium.</p><p><strong>Magnesium is blocked by certain foods,</strong> High protein, spinach, chard, and un-fermented soy, …</p><p><strong>Drugs cause magnesium deficiency</strong> diuretics, bronchodilators, birth control pills, insulin, digitalis, insulin, tetracycline, Corticosteroids, Nicotine, cisplatin (chemotherapy)</p><p><strong>Vitamin and Mineral Interactions with Magnesium</strong> “Sufficient vitamin D is necessary for the body to utilize magnesium” (wonder how much sufficient is)</p><p><strong>Heart Attacks</strong> 7 clinical studies have shown that 5-10 grams of intravenous magnesium reduced the risk of death by 55% after an acute heart attack.</p><p><strong>PMS</strong>  was reduced with 400 mg of Magnesium.

Apparently, very little of the body’s Magnesium is in the blood serum, and it is tightly regulated – except that when under stress, the body adds more Magnesium to the blood. It appears that tests for Magnesium which test the serum, are misleading, and white and red blood cell tests are an OK indication of blood in the cells of the body unless the body is under stress – such as an asthma attack. A better test is an EXATest – which measures the amount of Magnesium in the mouth. The best test is a “blood ionized magnesium test,” which, at the time of the book, was available only to researchers.</p><p>– – – – –</p><p><a href=http://drcarolyndean.com/2012/09/pico-ionic-magnesium/>Pico-Ionic Magnesium</a> Bioavailability (claimed)= 100% with no intestinal upset {Update Fall 2012}</p><p>4 ml per day, no laxative effect even if have IBS-diarrhea, Crohn’s, or colitis, $30</p><h4 id=magnesium-l-threonate--perhaps-more-bioavailable--jan2012postsmagnesium-l-threonate-perhaps-more-bioavailable><a href=/posts/magnesium-l-threonate-perhaps-more-bioavailable>Magnesium L-Threonate – perhaps more bioavailable – Jan 2012</a></h4><p><strong>Have not seen ANY human studies of L-Threonate as of Nov 2018</strong> -
