OBJECTIVE:

To explore the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and hypertension so as to provide rationales for developing preventive strategies and understanding the etiology of hypertension.

METHODS:

The articles on the association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and hypertension were retrieved by searching international and national databases from 2000 to 2011. The relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and hypertension was assessed by Meta-analysis with Stata11.0 software.

RESULTS:

The results of Meta analysis showed that the pooled OR values of hypertension with 25-hydroxyvitamin D level deficiency and sufficiency was 1.37 (95%CI 1.23 - 1.53). Subgroup analysis revealed in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, can be drawn between 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and the incidence of hypertension was statistically significant. The pooled OR values of hypertension with 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in 35 nmol/L and 35 - 68 nmol/L were 2.02 (95%CI 1.49 - 2.74) and 1.23 (95%CI 1.02 - 1.49) (P < 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS:

The 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is associated with hypertension. With regards to the question of whether or not the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level deficiency serves as one of the potential risk factor for hypertension, prospective studies of larger sample sizes are warranted.
