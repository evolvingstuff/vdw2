They have to move far away places like the leper communities because of intense social stigma.</p><p>Some have been successfully treated but they are left with the stigma of Leprosy.</p><p>Because they have difficulty finding jobs, they become beggars not by choice but by the necessity for survival.</p><p>Most of them move to leper colonies supported by charitable organizations.</p><p>This bacteria has been in existence since BC 600 and yet modern medicine is unable to eradicate it.</p><p>According to the WHO report the United States has about 150-250 new cases every year and Myanmar has about 1000 to 10,000 new cases a year.</p><p>The aim and objective of WHO report 2017 is to prevent disability with early diagnosis and early treatment.</p><p>Despite treatment with multidrug therapy, the disease is still in existence and is continuing.</p><p>New researches are coming out which is going to be very helpful in managing this disease.</p><p>This center is Metta Prahita Center in Ma Yan Chaung district, Hlegu Township Yangon.</p><p>I have been here six times now and have been donating Vitamin D3 and some cofactors.</p><p>I have watched the patients’ symptoms improved significantly.</p><p>Another important thing I noticed was that there have been recurrences despite adequate treatment.</p><p>Everyone looks very good today.</p><p><strong>Interview 1.</strong></p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/i1.jpg alt=image width=200><p>I am 80 years old. I feel good.</p><p>I am from a Shan ethnic group. The disease began when I was 8 years old. I had to leave school, and tended cows in the village for 10 years. I was treated at an American hospital in the city. The doctor’s name was Edward. My face was studded with lepromatous nodules. After years of treatment, I was able to get rid of bacteria. However, the disease recurred 10 years later.</p><p>I used to have high blood pressure, headaches and stomach problems.</p><p>After I took the vitamin D and other vitamins my symptoms have abated. The skin lesions, itching have disappeared.</p><ul><li>  -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -</li></ul><p>This is one of the instances where the disease recurs after successful treatment.</p><p>I started reading up about Leprosy and found out that it has a relationship with Vitamin D and its receptors. It also has a genetic component that one is born with.</p><p><strong>Interview 2</strong></p><p>      You look so much better than last time.</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/i2.jpg alt=image width=200><p>I finished up the whole bottle of Vitamins you gave me.</p><p>My name is Daw Khin Myo Nyunt. I am from Yangon. This disease began in 1989.</p><p>I did not know then that I had the disease. I used to be a lower school teacher. I had to leave my job when the disease became noticeable. At first, I tried to get the treatment at private clinics. I was told that I was cured but the disease recurred. It got gradually worse with the appearance of nodules and rashes. I was sick most of the time, appetite was lost and I did not feel well.</p><p>I moved to this place where I am more comfortable with my fellow patients. I don’t have to be embarrassed anymore.</p><p>Then you came along and gave us vitamins. I took the vitamins religiously.</p><p>Ever since I took the vitamins I slept very soundly. I feel fresh and do not need to eat a lot like I used to. My head is clear. I lost some weight too. My vitamins have run out for about a month now. My skin lesions are so much better.</p><p>I thank you so much.</p><ul><li>  -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -</li></ul><p>This bacteria has a predilection for skin, nerves and mucous producing glands in the nose.</p><p>The symptoms are weak muscles, neuropathy, foot ulcers, rashes, nodules, autoamputation and disfigurement.</p><p>In 1995 WHO began offering the drugs to treat Leprosy. Five different combinations of drugs were recommended.</p><p>Dapsone, Rifampin, Clofazimine, Minocycline, Ofloxacin.</p><p>Despite treatments, new cases and recurrences are still developing</p><p>It is time we need to reevaluate the current treatment regimen.</p><p>In Myanmar we have the Leprosy campaign, drugs were provided by WHO free of charge and yet we still have problems with new cases and recurrences.</p><p><strong>I would like to talk more about this Mycobacteria</strong></p><p>Thus bacteria is Mycobacterium leprae. It is a very slow growing bacteria the incubation period being 5 -20 years.</p><p>According to new researches, there seemed to be a problem with Vitamin D receptors either as an inborn genetic polymorphism in chromosome number 10 and 20 or the Vitamin D receptor gets inactivated by certain bacteria.</p><p>Vitamin D plays a very important role in the immune system.</p><p>We are seeing recurrences despite adequate treatments indicating a weak immune system.</p><p>Even in the same family, not everyone is affected despite being in the same environment indicating a genetic predisposition.</p><p><strong>Leprosy is 28 times more in those with Vitamin D receptor problems.</strong></p><p>If we add Vitamin D to the present treatment regimen of multidrug therapy we probably could improve the well being. Improve muscle weakness with less autoamputation and disfigurement</p><p>Vitamin D cofactors such as Magnesium, Zinc, Quercetin, Omega3, resveratrol are also necessary to compensate for the receptor problem.</p><p>Vitamin D is relatively cheap. Any foundation or government should be able to distribute to everyone concerned.</p><p><strong>Interview #3</strong></p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/i3.jpg alt=image width=200><p>My knees were hurting badly. Now that I have been taking the vitamin the pain has lessened.</p><p>I lost weight, my diabetes is under control ( now under 100 ) my kidney problem resolved.</p><p>I feel energetic. Thank you.</p><ul><li>  -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -</li></ul><p>It is quite evident that treating the disease only with antibiotics has not been as successful as evidenced by recurrences.</p><p>New research is coming out that there is an association between Vitamin D and Leprosy</p><p>This is the sixth time I have been coming here to this center and I have seen remarkable signs of progress - foot ulcers have healed up, the well being improved and skin lesions abated or lessened.</p><p>I think combining Vitamin D to the standard treatment would help prevent recurrences.</p><p>For further reading references and links will be provided in this video.</p><p>I am very happy and pleased with my own results supplementing with Vitamin D to Leprosy patients.</p><hr><p>Only the salient points were translated.</p><p>She left out some of the patient’s narratives about their life before they got to the center.</p><p><strong>Image of VitaminDWiki page in her video</strong></p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/win-vdw.jpg alt=image width=600><hr><p><strong>Short URL =</strong> is.gd/Leprosy</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>antibiotics</span>
