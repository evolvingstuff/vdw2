#### Daily or intermittent vitamin D supplementation in patients with or at risk of Osteoporosis: Position statement from the GRIO

Joint Bone Spine https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbspin.2025.105858

GRIO = Groupe de Recherche et d’Information sur les Ostéoporoses 

Advantages and disadvantages of intermittent versus daily vitamin D supplementation especially in adults with or at risk of osteoporosis are discussed by the Osteoporosis Research and Information Group (GRIO). The analysis of the literature suggests that intermittent long-term high doses vitamin D supplementation (such as 60,000 IU/month or more), may increase the risk of falls, fracture and premature death in certain populations, while daily doses of 800-1000 IU with calcium decrease falls and non-vertebral fractures in the elderly with vitamin D deficiency. In patients with or at risk of osteoporosis we hence recommend measuring the 25(OH)D concentration prior to supplementation and to provide vitamin D supplementation (with optimization of calcium intake if needed) to obtain a concentration between 30 and 60 ng/mL. We recommend the use of an initial loading dose, especially in those who need a quick repletion of vitamin D store (symptoms of osteomalacia and/or 25(OH)D concentration <12 ng/mL, patients eligible for treatment with potent antiresorptive therapy), followed by a maintenance dose. A daily supplementation should be the rule when possible. When daily forms are however not available or not reimbursed, we recommend, like other experts, to continue using intermittent dosing with the smallest available dose (≤ 50 000 IU) and the shortest interval between doses as a stopgap until reimbursement or adequate daily pharmaceutical forms (pills or soft capsules of 1000, 2000 IU) are available.
