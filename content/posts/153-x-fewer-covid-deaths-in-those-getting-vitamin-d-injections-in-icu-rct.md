##### Summary and notes by VitaminDWiki

* 4 days of 200,000 IU Vitamin D intramuscular injections while in ICU for COVID

* The “control group” got 10,000 IU daily for 4 days

* Vitamin D [Injections](/categories/injection) act slowly – better to have fast-acting <a href="/posts/sublingual-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Sublingual vitamin D">Sublingual vitamin D</a> for 4 days

* Would have been much better if patients had gotten Vitamin D BEFORE entering in ICU

* Vitamin D level achieved: 32 ng. Even less <a href="/posts/mortality" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Mortality">Mortality</a> expected if they had used larger doses (and get >40 ng)

* Founder of VitaminDWiki bought >20 lbs of Vitamin D in 2020 to give away free - but could not find a single taker

* Founder of VitaminDWiki  tried to start an RCT in 2020 using 400,000 IU of vitamin D, but was stopped by local corruption

Background: Although antiviral properties of vitamin D are recognized, the influence of parental Vit D supplementation

on COVID-19 disease has not been determined.

Objective: The aim of study was to evaluate impact of prompt treatment of Vit D deficiency on COVID-19 patients.

Patients and Methods: A randomized controlled experiment was carried out on 250 COVID-19 patients. Patients were

categorized into two cohorts: one cohort received daily intramuscular injection of 200,000 IU cholecalciferol for four

consecutive days, while other cohort received daily oral dose of 10,000 IU cholecalciferol. The latter group functioned as

control group. Before and after therapy, serum 25(OH)D level, inflammatory markers and electrolytes were measured,

besides, clinical follow-up.

Results: In Vit D group, the 25(OH)D levels considerably increased after 7 days compared to initial levels (32.48 ±9.64 Vs

13.77 ±6.51 ng/mL, respectively). All Vit D deficient patients have transitioned to sufficient status. Levels of markers (ESR

50.99±17.56 mm/hr, CRP 30.75 ±24 mg/L, and ferritin 392.05 ±139.17 ng/mL) decreased after seven days (29.74±8.97

mm/hr, 10.52 ±13 mg/L, and 94.59 ±27.14 ng/mL, respectively). A substantial clinical improvement occurred in Vit D

group compared to their initial condition. 

Also Vit D deficiency was found to significantly increase risk of COVID-19 mortality by factor of  **15.375**  <span>[AOR = 15.375, 95% CI: 1.898-124.52, p=0.01]</span>.

Conclusion: A daily intramuscular injection of 200,000 IU cholecalciferol for four consecutive days has been proven to

significantly enhance clinico-labatory parameters in COVID-19 patients. Considering higher Vit D supplementation as

a potential treatment for COVID-19 is a viable option
