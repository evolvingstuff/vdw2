&lt;p>I prepared this bibliography in order to see the level of acceptance for vitamin D affecting health outcomes for black Americans. (I omitted papers on bone health.) My impression is that it is not very well accepted. One reason given by researchers is that most of the vitamin D studies were performed on white, not black people. Another likely reason is that most of the studies are ecological or observational in nature, not from clinical trials.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dark skin pregnancies 2.6 times more likely to have low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/dark-skin-pregnancies-26-times-more-likely-to-have-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dark-skin-pregnancies-26-times-more-likely-to-have-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Prostate cancer in black men is 1.6 times more likely if a poor Vitamin D Receptor</title><link>/posts/prostate-cancer-in-black-men-is-16-times-more-likely-if-a-poor-vitamin-d-receptor.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/prostate-cancer-in-black-men-is-16-times-more-likely-if-a-poor-vitamin-d-receptor.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Evolution of Diverse Vitamin D Requirements – Masterjohn video</title><link>/posts/the-evolution-of-diverse-vitamin-d-requirements-masterjohn-video.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-evolution-of-diverse-vitamin-d-requirements-masterjohn-video.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Dr. Chris Masterjohn, Published on Aug 20, 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJtaEo0r7wk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJtaEo0r7wk&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whites have higher 25(OH)D than every other racial group, and the conventional explanation is that light skin evolved to allow sufficient vitamin D synthesis far away from the equator. In episode 24, I explain why these differences may relate to genetics of vitamin D metabolism that have nothing to do with skin color and may reflect a lower average need for 25(OH)D rather than a lower average ability to get enough. But &amp;ldquo;average&amp;rdquo; is the key word and when it comes to using this information on a practical level we need to look beyond racial categories and treat each person as an individual.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Many US kids have less than 40 ng of Vitamin D – 99 out of 100 blacks, 91 out of 100 whites</title><link>/posts/many-us-kids-have-less-than-40-ng-of-vitamin-d-99-out-of-100-blacks-91-out-of-100-whites.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/many-us-kids-have-less-than-40-ng-of-vitamin-d-99-out-of-100-blacks-91-out-of-100-whites.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="from-grassroots-healthhttpcampaignr20constantcontactcomrenderm1102200732336ca74eb2ed6-b5e0-4dbe-8482-4440a7c2750a--us-children-and-teens-in-2010">From &lt;a href="http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?m=1102200732336&amp;amp;ca=74eb2ed6-b5e0-4dbe-8482-4440a7c2750a">Grassroots Health&lt;/a> US children and teens in 2010&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>“(12.5%) of the population of greater Dublin was found to be vitamin D-deficient,”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>“Other studies have shown an association between social deprivation and lower vitamin D, possibly due to diet as vitamin D-rich foods such as oily fish or fortified foods tend to be more expensive. Also, these locations in Dublin are more ethnically diverse compared to other areas, with higher numbers of non-Caucasians. Increased skin pigmentation plus ethnic lifestyle choices such as traditional clothing and/or dietary habits can also increase the risk of deficiency.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D levels of East African tribes</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-levels-of-east-african-tribes.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-levels-of-east-african-tribes.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="from-grassroots-healthhttpcampaignr20constantcontactcomrenderm1102200732336cac4441e3e-6bb7-451e-8c80-ac51013eef4a-nov-2016">From &lt;a href="http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?m=1102200732336&amp;amp;ca=c4441e3e-6bb7-451e-8c80-ac51013eef4a">Grassroots Health&lt;/a> Nov 2016&lt;/h4>

&lt;li>“Polysomnography and actigraphy demonstrated that participants with vitamin D deficiencies had shorter sleeper duration, less REM sleep, and higher scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. In African-Americans, low vitamin D levels were significantly associated with shorter average sleep duration. There was no association between vitamin D levels and sleep duration with other races and ethnicities. Why the difference between races? While the answer is unclear, it may be due to differences in metabolism, receptor activity, and activation of vitamin D.”&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Epidemiology • Volume XX, Number XXX, XXX 2015&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To the Editor:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The recent article by Hofmann and colleagues1 reported increased association of chronic kidney disease with renal cell carcinoma for blacks, Asians, and Hispanics, but not whites. The black-white disparity for renal cell carcinoma incidence for blacks was attributed to hypertension and chronic kidney disease. The authors recommended additional studies to evaluate the possible factors underlying the association between chronic kidney disease and risk of renal cell carcinoma. This letter outlines the evidence that racial differences in 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> concentrations may explain the findings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>African immigrants: half are vitamin D deficient (based on Caucasian measures)</title><link>/posts/african-immigrants-half-are-vitamin-d-deficient-based-on-caucasian-measures.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/african-immigrants-half-are-vitamin-d-deficient-based-on-caucasian-measures.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="biochemical-and-clinical-deficiency-is-uncommon-in-african-immigrants-despite-a-high-prevalence-of-low-vitamin-d-the-africans-in-america-study">Biochemical and clinical deficiency is uncommon in African immigrants despite a high prevalence of low vitamin D: the Africans in America study.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>More than four million Americans present to the emergency department (ED) each year for evaluation after MVC. More than 90% of these individuals are discharged to home; evidence suggests that chronic musculoskeletal pain is common in this population and that rates of chronic pain development are increased in African Americans (AAs). Biological mechanisms responsible for elevated risk in AAs remain poorly understood. Vitamin D deficiency (VDD, defined as 25&lt;span>[OH]&lt;/span>D plasma levels &amp;lt;30 ng/mL) is known to be more prevalent among Aas.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blacks have 4X more Kidney disease than whites – probably due to low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/blacks-have-4x-more-kidney-disease-than-whites-probably-due-to-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/blacks-have-4x-more-kidney-disease-than-whites-probably-due-to-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="kidney-failure-a-leading-cause-of-death-in-african-americanshttpbaystatebannercomnews2015mar18kidney-failure-leading-cause-death-african-america-bay-state-banner">&lt;a href="http://baystatebanner.com/news/2015/mar/18/kidney-failure-leading-cause-death-african-america/">Kidney failure: A leading cause of death in African Americans&lt;/a> Bay State Banner&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The role of vitamin D in cardiovascular health remains debated as results have been inconsistent. Previous studies have not considered the bioavailability of 25-hydroxy vitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span>. Objectives of our study were to investigate the association between serum concentrations of total, free and bioavailable 25(OH)D and independent predictors of cardiovascular risk such as flow mediated dilatation (FMD) and augmentation index (AIx).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>African Americans need vitamin D intervention as well as education</title><link>/posts/african-americans-need-vitamin-d-intervention-as-well-as-education.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/african-americans-need-vitamin-d-intervention-as-well-as-education.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>The darker the skin, the lower the level of vitamin D – even in tropical Malaysia</title><link>/posts/the-darker-the-skin-the-lower-the-level-of-vitamin-d-even-in-tropical-malaysia.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-darker-the-skin-the-lower-the-level-of-vitamin-d-even-in-tropical-malaysia.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-status-in-malaysian-men-and-its-associated-factors">Vitamin D Status in Malaysian Men and Its Associated Factors&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency is common in sickle cell anaemia (SCA, HbSS), although its significance and optimal means of correction are unknown. We conducted an audit to assess the clinical significance of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD) deficiency in children with SCA and to evaluate two methods of vitamin D supplementation. We audited 25-OHD levels in 81 children with SCA and looked for statistical associations with biochemical, haematological and clinical parameters. In a separate group of regularly transfused children with SCA, we compared changes in 25-OHD blood concentrations following treatment with either high-dose intramuscular ergocalciferol (n = 15) or 4 days of high-dose oral cholecalciferol (n = 64). Ninety-one percent of children with SCA had 25-OHD levels &amp;lt;20 μg/L. The 25-OHD levels were negatively correlated with increasing age (P &amp;lt; 0.001) but showed no significant relationship to laboratory measurements, transcranial Doppler velocities or hospital attendance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D-binding protein and vitamin D status of black Americans and white Americans</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-binding-protein-and-vitamin-d-status-of-black-americans-and-white-americans.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-binding-protein-and-vitamin-d-status-of-black-americans-and-white-americans.html</guid><description>&lt;p>N Engl J Med. 2013 Nov 21;369(21):1991-2000. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1306357.">doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1306357.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>PURPOSE:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Disparities in both colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and survival impact African Americans (AAs) more than other US ethnic groups. Because vitamin D is thought to protect against CRC and AAs have lower serum vitamin D levels, genetic variants that modulate the levels of active hormone in the tissues could explain some of the cancer health disparity. Consequently, we hypothesized that genetic variants in vitamin D-related genes are associated with CRC risk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bone density does not decrease with lower vitamin D levels in blacks as it does in whites</title><link>/posts/bone-density-does-not-decrease-with-lower-vitamin-d-levels-in-blacks-as-it-does-in-whites.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/bone-density-does-not-decrease-with-lower-vitamin-d-levels-in-blacks-as-it-does-in-whites.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-status-does-not-influence-bone-density-in-africans-abstract-p168">Vitamin D Status does not influence Bone Density in Africans Abstract P168:&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Without regard to race, the Institute of Medicine states that to protect bone health vitamin D, measured as 25(OH)D, should be &amp;gt;20 ng/mL while levels of 12-19 ng/mL are inadequate and levels of &amp;lt;12 ng/mL are deficient. However, even when 25(OH)D levels are low, bone mineral density (BMD) is not compromised in African-Americans. The relationship of 25(OH)D levels to BMD in Africans is unknown. Therefore 78 African immigrants to the United States (77% male, median age 35y, age range 22-63y (95% CI: 36, 40)) had 25(OH)D levels and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Distribution of 25(OH)D levels by quartile was determined (Fig. 1). The distribution of whole body BMD across quartiles of 25(OH)D was assessed (Fig. 2). Median 25(0H)D levels was 21 ng/mL (95% CI: 20, 23) with 47% having 25(OH)D&amp;lt;20 ng/mL and 8% having 25(OH)D &amp;lt;12 ng/mL. BMD did not change across quartiles of 25(OH)D (Fig. 2). Spearman correlation between BMD and 25(OH)D was r =0.1, P=0.5. As there was no relationship between vitamin D levels and BMD, low 25(OH)D levels are not a predictor of low bone density in Africans.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Darned ancestors: Light skin is more expensive than dark skin</title><link>/posts/darned-ancestors-light-skin-is-more-expensive-than-dark-skin.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/darned-ancestors-light-skin-is-more-expensive-than-dark-skin.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>People with light skin often buy sunscreen, deal with sunburn, and have to pay dermatologists to remove skin cancer&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the vitamin D status and its determinants in US prison inmates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>HYPOTHESIS:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given the uniformity of dietary intake amongst inmates, vitamin D status will be determined by non-dietary factors such as skin pigmentation, security level-, and the duration of incarceration.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hypothesis - Dark skin evolved to avoid skin cancer</title><link>/posts/hypothesis-dark-skin-evolved-to-avoid-skin-cancer.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hypothesis-dark-skin-evolved-to-avoid-skin-cancer.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="was-skin-cancer-a-selective-force-for-black-pigmentation-in-early-hominin-evolution">Was skin cancer a selective force for black pigmentation in early hominin evolution?&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Melanin provides a crucial filter for solar UV radiation and its genetically determined variation influences both skin pigmentation and risk of cancer. Genetic evidence suggests that the acquisition of a highly stable melanocortin 1 receptor allele promoting black pigmentation arose around the time of savannah colonization by hominins at some 1-2 Ma. The adaptive significance of dark skin is generallybelievedtobeprotectionfromUVdamagebut thepathologies that might have had a deleterious impact on survival and/or reproductive fitness, though much debated, are uncertain. Here, I suggest that data on age-associated cancer incidence and lethality in albinos living at low latitudes in both Africa and Central America support the contention that skin cancer could have provided a potent selective force for the emergence of black skin in early hominins.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dark skinned NCAA basketball players were 15X more likely to have low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/dark-skinned-ncaa-basketball-players-were-15x-more-likely-to-have-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dark-skinned-ncaa-basketball-players-were-15x-more-likely-to-have-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="prevalence-of-abnormal-vitamin-d-levels-among-division-i-ncaa-athletes">Prevalence of Abnormal Vitamin D Levels Among Division I NCAA Athletes&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Previous studies suggest that circulating 25(OH)D may favorably influence cardiorespiratory fitness and fat oxidation. However, these relationships have not been examined in older adult women of different ethnic groups. The objectives of this study were to determine whether serum 25(OH)D is related to cardiovascular fitness (VO2max) in sedentary women ages ≥60 years and to determine whether these associations differ between African Americans (AA) and European Americans (EA). A secondary aim was to determine whether serum 25(OH)D is correlated with respiratory quotient (RQ) during submaximal exercise.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why India's vitamin D deficiency is grim - 40 pages</title><link>/posts/why-indias-vitamin-d-deficiency-is-grim-40-pages.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/why-indias-vitamin-d-deficiency-is-grim-40-pages.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Many healthy African Americans got above 33 ng with 4,000 IU of vitamin D – RCT</title><link>/posts/many-healthy-african-americans-got-above-33-ng-with-4000-iu-of-vitamin-d-rct.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/many-healthy-african-americans-got-above-33-ng-with-4000-iu-of-vitamin-d-rct.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="dose-response-to-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-african-americans-results-of-a-4-arm-randomized-placebo-controlled-trial">Dose response to vitamin D supplementation in African Americans: results of a 4-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled trial&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Incidence rates of skin cancer increase with decreasing latitude in Norway, as in many other countries with white populations. The latitudinal trends of the incidence rates of skin cancer were studied and compared with data for vitamin D-induced by UV and for vitamin D intake. The north-south gradient for CMM incidence rates on sun exposed skin is much smaller than those for BCC and SCC, and that for BCC is smaller than that for SCC. This indicates that SCC and BCC are mainly due to solar UVB, while UVA may play a significant role for CMM and a smaller role for BCC, since the north-south gradient of annual UVB fluences is larger than that of UVA fluences. However, there is an inverse latitudinal gradient of skin cancer in central Europe. This is probably due to a gradient of skin color, since white skin is an important determinant of increased risk of skin cancer. The role of vitamin D for skin cancer risk is difficult to evaluate, since serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, as well as vitamin D intakes, are widely different from country to country. Still, epidemiological evidence indicates a role: for melanomas arising on non-sun exposed body localizations (uveal melanomas, melanomas arising in the vulva and perianal/anorectal regions) there appears to be no latitudinal gradient, or, a negative gradient, i.e., increasing rates with decreasing latitude as would be expected if UV-generated vitamin D plays a protective role. Both skin cancer risk and vitamin D photosynthesis decrease with increasing skin darkness.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Depression in pregnant blacks strongly associated to vitamin D levels</title><link>/posts/depression-in-pregnant-blacks-strongly-associated-to-vitamin-d-levels.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/depression-in-pregnant-blacks-strongly-associated-to-vitamin-d-levels.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-nutritional-status-and-antenatal-depressive-symptoms-in-african-american-women">Vitamin D nutritional status and antenatal depressive symptoms in African American women.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with depression; however, no studies have examined the relationship of vitamin D and antenatal depression. Antenatal depression increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes and poorer postpartum maternal and infant health. African American women are at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency and antenatal depression. Thus, we examined if early pregnancy vitamin D nutrition (VDN) was associated with antenatal depressive symptoms among African American women in the second trimester of pregnancy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Another indiction that lower level of vitamin D are OK in blacks – Anemia</title><link>/posts/another-indiction-that-lower-level-of-vitamin-d-are-ok-in-blacks-anemia.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/another-indiction-that-lower-level-of-vitamin-d-are-ok-in-blacks-anemia.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vitamin-d-race-and-risk-for-anemia-in-children">Vitamin D, Race, and Risk for Anemia in Children.&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>High dietary intake of calcium has been classified as a probable cause of prostate cancer, although the mechanism underlying the association between dietary calcium and prostate cancer risk is unclear. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a key regulator of calcium absorption. In the small intestine, VDR expression is regulated by the CDX-2 transcription factor, which binds a polymorphic site in the VDR gene promoter. We examined VDR Cdx2 genotype and calcium intake, assessed by a food frequency questionnaire, in 533 African-American prostate cancer cases (256 with advanced stage at diagnosis, 277 with localized stage) and 250 African-American controls who participated in the California Collaborative Prostate Cancer Study. We examined the effects of genotype, calcium intake, and diet-gene interactions by conditional logistic regression. Compared with men in the lowest quartile of calcium intake, men in the highest quartile had an approximately twofold increased risk of localized and advanced prostate cancer (odds ratio &lt;span>[OR]&lt;/span> =  &lt;strong>2.20&lt;/strong> , 95% confidence interval &lt;span>[CI]&lt;/span> = 1.40, 3.46), with a significant dose-response. Poor absorbers of calcium (VDR Cdx2 GG genotype) had a significantly lower risk of advanced prostate cancer (OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.19, 0.90). The gene-calcium interaction was statistically significant (p = 0.03). Among men with calcium intake below the median (680 mg/day), carriers of the G allele had an approximately 50% decreased risk compared with men with the AA genotype. These findings suggest a link between prostate cancer risk and high intestinal absorption of calcium.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tuberculosis, ethnic differences, and vitamin D</title><link>/posts/tuberculosis-ethnic-differences-and-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/tuberculosis-ethnic-differences-and-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="ethnic-differences-affect-immune-response-to-tuberculosis-infection">Ethnic Differences Affect Immune Response To Tuberculosis Infection&lt;/h2>

At northern latitudes, the power of sunlight is attenuated, especially during winter, so that little or no vitamin D is formed in the skin.1 Heavy skin pigmentation reduces the amount of vitamin D formed in the skin, which is why infants with dark skin pigmentation tend to be in less satisfactory vitamin D status than infants with light skin pigmentation2 and why they are at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency rickets.3-5 Infants living at northern latitudes depend on ingestion of preformed vitamin D for the maintenance of vitamin D sufficiency during winter and possibly year round in the case of infants with darkly pigmented skin. &lt;strong>The amount of preformed vitamin D required by infants in the absence of endogenous synthesis is not exactly known but is thought to be between 100 and 200 international units (IU) per day&lt;/strong> . A daily intake of 400 IU of vitamin D is believed to prevent rickets reliably and is considered free of adverse effects.6 &lt;strong>The Institute of Medicine considers 200 IU per day to be an adequate intake for infants.7&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ricket was known to be associated with dark skin and breast feeding a century ago - 2005</title><link>/posts/ricket-was-known-to-be-associated-with-dark-skin-and-breast-feeding-a-century-ago-2005.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ricket-was-known-to-be-associated-with-dark-skin-and-breast-feeding-a-century-ago-2005.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="reemerging-nutritional-rickets-a-historical-perspective">Reemerging Nutritional Rickets: A Historical Perspective&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Recent case reports highlight the resurgence of rickets in certain groups of breastfed infants. Infants residing in the North, irrespective of skin color, and dark-skinned African American infants residing anywhere in the United States are most vulnerable to nutritional rickets if they are exclusively breastfed past age 6 months without vitamin D supplementation. &lt;strong>At the turn of the 20th century, rickets was nearly universal among African American infants living in the North&lt;/strong> . The discovery of vitamin D, the initiation of public health campaigns to fortify infant foods with vitamin D, and the supplementation of vitamin D to breastfed infants were responsible for overcoming the rickets scourge. We review a classic nutritional study by Alfred F. Hess, one of the greatest clinical nutritional researchers of the early 20th century, in the context of the resurgence of rickets, especially among dark-skinned infants. The Columbus Hill district, a black community of New York, NY, served as the setting for the study. Sixty-five infants (aged 1-17 months) entered a 6-month open-label trial of daily cod liver oil therapy. Participants were assessed for signs of rickets at recruitment and at 2, 4, and 6 months. Cod liver oil prevented the development of rickets in 34 (92%) of 37 infants treated for 6 months and in 7 (58%) of 12 treated for 4 months. Of the 16 infants who did not take the prescribed treatment, rickets progressed unremittingly in 15. Hess translated his success into a public health campaign leading to the development of the first rickets clinic in 1917. This was the first step in the conquest of the rickets epidemic of the early 20th century.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Increased risk of multiple sclerosis risk in African Americans due to genes</title><link>/posts/increased-risk-of-multiple-sclerosis-risk-in-african-americans-due-to-genes.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/increased-risk-of-multiple-sclerosis-risk-in-african-americans-due-to-genes.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="genetic-risk-variants-in-african-americans-with-multiple-sclerosis">Genetic risk variants in African Americans with multiple sclerosis&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>BACKGROUND: In human beings, dark skin requires more exposure to ultraviolet light to synthesize the same amount of vitamin D as lighter skin. It is has been repeatedly shown that at the latitude of the United States there are vitamin D disparities related to skin color. Although inadequate vitamin D status and health disparities have been associated with many of the same diseases, neither nutrition policy nor public health policy in the United States currently recognizes any role at all for vitamin D as a determinant of health disparities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Black infants had far lower vitamin D levels which did not vary with season</title><link>/posts/black-infants-had-far-lower-vitamin-d-levels-which-did-not-vary-with-season.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/black-infants-had-far-lower-vitamin-d-levels-which-did-not-vary-with-season.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="racial-variation-in-vitamin-d-cord-blood-concentration-in-white-and-black-male-neonates">Racial variation in vitamin D cord blood concentration in White and Black male neonates&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that disproportionately affects African American females. The causes of SLE are unknown but postulated to be a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental triggers. Vitamin D deficiency is one of the possible environmental triggers. In this study we evaluated relationships between vitamin D status, cellular aging (telomere length) and anti-telomere antibodies among African American Gullah women with SLE. The study population included African American female SLE patients and unaffected controls from the Sea Island region of South Carolina. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured using a nonchromatographic radioimmunoassay. Telomere length was measured in genomic DNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by monochrome multiplex quantitative PCR. Anti-telomere antibody levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients with SLE had significantly shorter telomeres and higher anti-telomere antibody titers compared to age- and gender-matched unaffected controls. There was a positive correlation between anti-telomere antibody levels and disease activity among patients and a significant correlation of shorter telomeres with lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in both patients and controls. In follow-up examination of a subset of the patients, the patients who remained vitamin D deficient tended to have shorter telomeres than those patients whose 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were repleted. Increasing 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in African American patients with SLE may be beneficial in maintaining telomere length and preventing cellular aging. Moreover, anti-telomere antibody levels may be a promising biomarker of SLE status and disease activity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Most immigrant women in Sweden had little vitamin D and lots of muscle pain</title><link>/posts/most-immigrant-women-in-sweden-had-little-vitamin-d-and-lots-of-muscle-pain.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/most-immigrant-women-in-sweden-had-little-vitamin-d-and-lots-of-muscle-pain.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-intake-and-status-in-immigrant-and-native-swedish-women-a-study-at-a-primary-health-care-centre-located-at-60on-in-sweden">Vitamin D intake and status in immigrant and native Swedish women: a study at a primary health care centre located at 60oN in Sweden&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The overall health of the American population has improved over the past few decades, but not all Americans have benefitted equally from these improvements. Minority populations, in particular, continue to lag behind whites in a number of areas, including quality of care, access to care, timeliness, and outcomes. Other health care problems that disproportionately affect minorities include provider biases, poor provider-patient communication, and health literacy issues.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Similar response to Vitamin D supplements by senior white and black women</title><link>/posts/similar-response-to-vitamin-d-supplements-by-senior-white-and-black-women.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/similar-response-to-vitamin-d-supplements-by-senior-white-and-black-women.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="effects-of-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-older-african-american-women">Effects of Vitamin D Supplementation in Older African American Women&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes coronary artery disease and stroke, is the leading cause of mortality in the nation. Excess CVD morbidity and premature mortality in the African American community is one of the most striking examples of racial/ ethnic disparities in health outcomes. African Americans also suffer from increased rates of hypovitaminosis D, which has emerged as an independent risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. This overview examines the potential role of hypovitaminosis D as a contributor to racial and ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD). We review the epidemiology of vitamin D and CVD in African Americans and the emerging biological roles of vitamin D in key CVD signaling pathways that may contribute to the epidemiological findings and provide the foundation for future therapeutic strategies for reducing health disparities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Low vitamin D is a risk factor for vascular diseases in African Americans</title><link>/posts/low-vitamin-d-is-a-risk-factor-for-vascular-diseases-in-african-americans.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/low-vitamin-d-is-a-risk-factor-for-vascular-diseases-in-african-americans.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="hypovitaminosis-d-as-a-contributory-factor-to-vascular-disease-in-african-americans-a-graded-literature-review">Hypovitaminosis D as a Contributory Factor to Vascular Disease in African-Americans: A graded literature review&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>The pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder accounts for an inverse relationship between bone mineralization and vascular calcification in progressive nephropathy. Inverse associations between bone mineral density (BMD) and calcified atherosclerotic plaque are also observed in individuals of European and African ancestry without nephropathy, suggesting a mechanistic link between these processes that is independent of kidney disease.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First and 2nd generation migrants 2X more likely to have psychotic disorders</title><link>/posts/first-and-2nd-generation-migrants-2x-more-likely-to-have-psychotic-disorders.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/first-and-2nd-generation-migrants-2x-more-likely-to-have-psychotic-disorders.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="ethnic-minority-position-and-risk-for-psychotic-disorders">Ethnic minority position and risk for psychotic disorders&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Veling, Wim&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Purpose of review: This article reviews the recent literature about migration, ethnic minority position and the risk of psychotic disorders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recent findings: A meta-analysis found that both first and second-generation migrants have on average a two-fold increase in risk for psychotic disorders. In the Netherlands, the risk was most elevated for individuals who migrated in early childhood. Several studies investigated diagnostic ethnic bias and reported greater likelihood of schizophrenia diagnosis in ethnic minority patients at the cost of diagnosis of affective psychotic disorders. Neighbourhood ethnic density was related to prevalence of psychotic experiences in ethnic minority populations in the UK. Perceived discrimination was associated with severity of psychotic and depressive symptoms in ethnic minority patients. Both weak and strong ethnic identification, as well as experiences of social adversity, were related to risk for psychosis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sickle cell and low vitamin D – 3 presentations</title><link>/posts/sickle-cell-and-low-vitamin-d-3-presentations.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/sickle-cell-and-low-vitamin-d-3-presentations.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>All presented at 2012 American Society of Hematology December 8-11, 2012 Atlanta, GA&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Background&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many non-Western immigrants suffer musculoskeletal pain that is hard to treat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This study examines the effect of high-dose vitamin D on nonspecific persistent musculoskeletal complaints in vitamin-D-deficient non-Western immigrants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What This Study Found&lt;/p>
&lt;p>High-dose vitamin D supplementation may have a positive effect on persistent musculoskeletal pain among vitamin D-deficient patients. A study of 84 non-Western immigrants in Western Europe, a population prone to vitamin D deficiency and musculoskeletal problems, revealed a small positive effect on pain 6 weeks after supplementation with 150,000 IU of Vitamin D3 on vitamin D-deficient patients.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Autism associated with low UVB</title><link>/posts/autism-associated-with-low-uvb.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/autism-associated-with-low-uvb.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="autism-prevalence-in-the-united-states-with-respect-to-solar-uv-b-doses">Autism prevalence in the United States with respect to solar UV-B doses:&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Evidence is mounting that vitamin D deficiency is intimately involved in autism. We report on autism prevalence by US state for those aged 6–17 y in 2010 with respect to indices of solar UV-B (UVB) doses. We calculated autism prevalence rates for white, black and Asian Americans by using total prevalence and relative populations of minors for each ethnic group by state. Analyses omit AK and HI (considered extreme cases), WY (no data), along with AZ and ND for black Americans (low numbers) and DC, ME, MT, ND and SD for Asian Americans (low numbers). For white Americans, the regression coefficient for solar UVB doses and autism prevalence ranged from -0.52 in January to -0.57 in October. For black Americans, the regression coefficient for latitude was 0.61, whereas those for solar UVB ranged from -0.55 to -0.61. For Asian Americans, the values for solar UVB ranged from -0.28 to -0.38. The inverse correlation between solar UVB and autism prevalence is similar to that for many types of cancer in the US. The journal literature indicates that adverse effects on fetal brain development during pregnancy due to vitamin D deficiency can explain these findings. However, we cannot rule out a role of vitamin D deficiency in early life. These results add to the evidence that vitamin D deficiency may be an important risk factor for autism and suggest that pregnant women and autistic individuals raise their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations above 30 ng/ml.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D Receptor genes bb and BB and Osteoporosis, esp. for blacks – meta-analysis</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-receptor-genes-bb-and-bb-and-osteoporosis-esp-for-blacks-meta-analysis.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-receptor-genes-bb-and-bb-and-osteoporosis-esp-for-blacks-meta-analysis.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-receptor-bsmi-polymorphism-and-osteoporosis-risk-a-meta-analysis-from-26-studies">Vitamin D Receptor BsmI Polymorphism and Osteoporosis Risk: A Meta-Analysis from 26 Studies&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Introduction: This study describes the prevalence of low vitamin D levels in pregnancy in a diverse urban population.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of 2839 women who gave birth at a Michigan hospital between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2009 and had at least 1 vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span>) measurement during their pregnancies. Race/ethnic group, wearing the hijab, and season of 25(OH)D sample collection were used in the descriptive analysis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Forearm fracture 3.5X more often in black children with low levels of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/forearm-fracture-35x-more-often-in-black-children-with-low-levels-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/forearm-fracture-35x-more-often-in-black-children-with-low-levels-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="bone-mineral-density-and-vitamin-d-status-among-african-american-children-with-forearm-fractures">Bone mineral density and vitamin d status among african american children with forearm fractures.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>We evaluated the prevalence of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> deficiency and the risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in HIV-infected patients in the South-Central United States. The study consisted of a cross-sectional assessment of vitamin D levels in HIV-infected patients receiving routine clinical care from a private practice in Houston, Texas (latitude 29°N). Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D less than 20?ng/ml (&amp;lt;50?nmol/liter). Two-hundred enrolled patients were surveyed with a vitamin D questionnaire to determine daily supplemental vitamin D intake, dietary vitamin D intake, and average sunlight exposure (minutes/day). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine significant risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. Median 25(OH)D was 15.5?ng/ml (interquartile range 10.9-24.6) for the total population (n=200).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fair skin has lower vitamin D levels than dark skin – contrary to other studies – 2009</title><link>/posts/fair-skin-has-lower-vitamin-d-levels-than-dark-skin-contrary-to-other-studies-2009.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/fair-skin-has-lower-vitamin-d-levels-than-dark-skin-contrary-to-other-studies-2009.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="pigmentation-and-vitamin-d-metabolism-in-caucasians-low-vitamin-d-serum-levels-in-fair-skin-types-in-the-uk">Pigmentation and vitamin D metabolism in Caucasians: low vitamin D serum levels in fair skin types in the UK.&lt;/h4>
