#### Korean Study Ties COVID-19 Vaccination to Inflammatory Eye Disorder Uveitis

 **[TrialSiteNews](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/korean-study-ties-covid-19-vaccination-to-inflammatory-eye-disorder-uveitis-bdccc512)** 

* “Symptoms of uveitis can include eye redness, pain, light sensitivity, blurred vision, and floaters. The condition can have various causes, including autoimmune disorders, infections, trauma, and sometimes, the cause remains unknown (idiopathic).”

* “The group operating out of Hanyang University reported in JAMA Network Ophthalmology that out of 543,737 individuals with a history of uveitis, 473,934 individuals…had documented COVID-19 vaccination and were included in analysis.”

* “The study investigators observed that “the cumulative incidence of postvaccination uveitis was 8.6% at 3 months, 12.5% at 6 months, and  **16.8% at 1 year** , predominantly of the anterior type.” The incidence nearly doubled in just a year after the vaccination event.”
