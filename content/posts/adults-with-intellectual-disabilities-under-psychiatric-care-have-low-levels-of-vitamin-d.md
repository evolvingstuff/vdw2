In this study people in psych wards were almost 2X more likely to have < 20 ng of vitamin D

It is well known that people in psych wards have low level of vitamin D

Many of the categories of people at high risk of being vitamin D deficient are listed in the abstract

Background

People with intellectual disabilities have a high risk of osteoporosis and fractures, which could partly be as a result of vitamin D deficiency.

Aims

To compare the serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels of 155 patients with intellectual disabilities under psychiatric care and 192 controls, investigate potential risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in people with intellectual disabilities and assess available treatments.

Method

Cross-sectional observational study followed by treatment evaluation.

Results

Almost twice as many patients with intellectual disabilities had vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <50 nmol/l) compared with controls (77.3% v. 39.6%, P<0.0001). 

In the intellectual disabilities group, 

* winter season (P<0.0001), 

* dark skin pigmentation (P<0.0001), 

* impaired mobility (P = 0.002) and 

* obesity (P = 0.001) 

were independently associated with lower serum 25(OH)D. 

In most patients, 800 IU colecalciferol daily normalised 25(OH)D levels.

Conclusions

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in people with intellectual disabilities, partly because of insufficient exposure to sunlight. Screening and treatment strategies, aiming to reduce these patients’ high fracture risk, should be introduced. Similar strategies may be required in other psychiatric populations at risk for fractures and with a tendency to spend excessive time indoors.

> Patients with psychosis did have significantly lower vitamin D levels than healthy controls (6 studies analysed)

> 2 studies examined the relationship between severity of vitamin D deficiency and severity of psychotic symptoms: 

> &nbsp; &nbsp;1 found no correlations; 

> &nbsp; &nbsp;1 found correlations between low vitamin D and high disorientation, psychomotor activity, low physical energy and somatic complaints.
