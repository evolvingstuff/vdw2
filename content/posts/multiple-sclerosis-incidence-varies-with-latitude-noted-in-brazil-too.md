 **Highlights** 

* This meta-analysis based on 19 published crude prevalence studies from Brazil has shown that the prevalence of multiple sclerosis is low compared with western countries on the northern hemisphere.

* In Brazil there is a strong and statistical significant latitudinal gradient with higher prevalence at high southern latitudes. This gradient could not be explained alone by racial differences between the regions.

Epidemiological studies of multiple sclerosis (MS) conducted in Latin America have revealed prevalence rates of this disease from low to medium. The aim of this study was to gather and analyze surveys on prevalence conducted in Brazil, noting its variability in different regions. Systematic review was held in electronic databases and manual search in abstracts concerning ECTRIMS, LACTRIMS and Brazilian Congress of Neurology. Nineteen studies made reference to prevalence rates that ranged from 1.36/100,000 to 27.2/100.000 inhabitants. More studies on the epidemiology of MS in Brazil will be needed for a better assessment of its prevalence and profile.
