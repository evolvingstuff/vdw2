#### Comments by the founder of VitaminDWiki

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Finally, fortification started to be treated as a Science!</span>** 

Have not seen anything like this before

A great first step

It still needs to consider those:

1. With different eating styles 

   * vegetarian, meat, gluten free, lactose intolerant, fast-food, etc

1. Aged 65+

1. With poor guts  (less Vitamin D absorbed)

1. In poor health (and need even more vitamin D)

1. Needing additional micronutrients – such as Magnesium and Omega-3

1. Who can elect to fortify or not 

   * let the individual decide – provide food at same price with and without fortification

1. Who want to do home fortification of a variety of food products

1. Who are overweght or obese - and so need much more vitamin D

1. Who have poor Vitamin D genes

   * Have far less blood response to same vitamin D dose

   * Have far less Vitamin D is tissue, even if Vitamin D  in blood is OK
