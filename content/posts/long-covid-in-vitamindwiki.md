#### More than 50 Long-term effects of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis - Jan 2021

Prerint [doi: https](https://doi.org/https)://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.27.21250617

COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, can involve sequelae and other medical complications that last weeks to months after initial recovery, which has come to be called Long-COVID or COVID long-haulers. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to identify studies assessing long-term effects of COVID-19 and estimates the prevalence of each symptom, sign, or laboratory parameter of patients at a post-COVID-19 stage. LitCOVID (PubMed and Medline) and Embase were searched by two independent researchers. All articles with original data for detecting long-term COVID-19 published before 1st of January 2021 and with a minimum of 100 patients were included. For effects reported in two or more studies, meta-analyses using a random-effects model were performed using the MetaXL software to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% CI. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviewers and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed. A total of  **18,251 publications**  were identified, of which  **15 met the inclusion criteria** .

The prevalence of 55 long-term effects was estimated, 21 meta-analyses were performed, and 47,910 patients were included. The follow-up time ranged from 15 to 110 days post-viral infection. The age of the study participants ranged between 17 and 87 years.

It was estimated that  **80%**  (95% CI 65-92) of the patients that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed  **one or more long-term symptoms** .

The five most common symptoms were

* fatigue (58%),

* headache (44%),

* attention disorder (27%),

* hair loss (25%), and

* dyspnea (24%). <span>[difficult or labored breathing]</span>

All meta-analyses showed medium (n=2) to high heterogeneity (n=13). In order to have a better understanding, future studies need to stratify by

* sex,

* age,

* previous comorbidities,

* severity of COVID-19 (ranging from asymptomatic to severe), and

* duration of each symptom.

From the clinical perspective, multi-disciplinary teams are crucial to developing preventive measures, rehabilitation techniques, and clinical management strategies with whole-patient perspectives designed to address long COVID-19 care.

 **Clipped from the PDF** 

The patient follow-up time ranged from 14 days to 110 days.

Six out of the 11 studies included only patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

The rest of the studies mixed mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 patients.

* An estimated 962,000 people, or 1.5% of the population, have experienced self-reported long Covid symptoms in the U.K., according to data from the Office for National Statistics published earlier this month. More than a third of those said they’ve suffered for more than a year.
