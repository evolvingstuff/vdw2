Psychiatric patients are at risk of hypovitaminosis D and Covid-19-related mortality. In addition to the mental health benefits, vitamin D supplementation may be potentially effective in preventing severe forms of Covid-19 infections. Vitamin D supplementation is not necessary and is not reimbursed in France for this indication. A monthly supplementation of 50,000 IU may be sufficient in most cases. Double the dose is recommended for obese patients. The risk of renal lithiasis is not increased at these doses, even when supplemented in a patient without vitamin D deficiency. The Covid-19 crisis is an opportunity to disseminate vitamin D supplementation in psychiatric patients, as it has been shown to be effective in other respiratory diseases such as mild upper respiratory tract infections and influenza.
