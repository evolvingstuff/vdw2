Background

Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae and mainly affects skin, peripheral nerves. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism has been found to be associated with leprosy. Vitamin D has been shown to control several host immunomodulating properties through VDR gene. Vitamin D deficiency was also found to be linked to an increased risk for several infections and metabolic diseases.

Objective

In the present study, we investigated the association of VDR gene polymorphism, mRNA gene expression of VDR and the vitamin D levels with leprosy and its reactional states.

Methodology

A total of 305 leprosy patients consisting of tuberculoid (TT), borderline tuberculoid (BT), borderline lepromatous (BL), lepromatous leprosy (LL), as well as 200 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VDR Taq1, Fok1 and Apa1, as well as the expression of VDR mRNA gene using PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and real-time PCR respectively. We also performed ELISA to measure vitamin D levels.

Result

We observed that SNP of VDR gene (Fok1 and Taq1) are associated with the leprosy disease. The allelic frequency distribution of T and t allele (p = 0.0037), F and f allele (p = 0.0024) was significantly higher in leprosy patients and healthy controls. ff genotype of Fok1 was found to be associated with leprosy patients <span>[p = 0.0004; OR (95% CI) __3.148__ (1.662–5.965)]</span>. The recessive model of Fok1 genotype was also found to be significantly associated in leprosy patients in comparison to healthy controls <span>[p = 0.00004; OR (95% CI) __2.85__ (1.56–5.22)]</span>. Leprosy patients are significantly associated with t-F-a haplotype. Further, VDR gene expression was found to be lower in non-reaction group compared to that of reaction group of leprosy and healthy controls.  **<span style="color:#00F;">Paradoxically, we noted no difference in the levels of vitamin D between leprosy patients and healthy controls.</span>** 

Conclusion

Blood levels of vitamin D do not play any role in clinical manifestations of any forms of leprosy. ff genotype of Fok1 and tt genotype of Taq1 was found to be associated with leprosy per se. Association of t-F-a haplotype with leprosy was found to be significant and could be used as a genetic marker to identify individuals at high risk for developing leprosy. VDR gene expression was lower in TT/BT and BL/LL groups of leprosy in comparison to that of healthy controls.

Author summary

Present study was carried out to find out the association of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism, mRNA gene expression of VDR gene and level of vitamin D with leprosy reactions and leprosy patients. Surprisingly, level of vitamin D in leprosy patients was not found to be associated with the disease and its manifestations. VDR genotypes (Fok1 and Taq1) were found to be associated with leprosy patients. t-F-a haplotype was significantly associated with leprosy patients. Gene expression of vitamin D receptor was lower in leprosy patients in comparison to healthy controls.

#### Higher VDR, much less Leprosy - March 2019

 **[Correlation of Serum Vitamin D Receptor Level with Bacterial Index in Multibacillary Leprosy Patients at Sanglah General Hospital, Bali-Indonesia](http://biomedpharmajournal.org/vol12no1/correlation-of-serum-vitamin-d-receptor-level-with-bacterial-index-in-multibacillary-leprosy-patients-at-sanglah-general-hospital-bali-indonesia/)** 

* "For the correlation of plasma VDR level and the bacterial index, using Spearman correlation, there was strong negative correlation between plasma VDR level and bacterial index (r = – 0.954; p < 0.001)."

Mycobacterium leprae infection depends on the competence of the host immune defense to induce effective protection against this intracellular pathogen. The present study investigated the serum levels of vitamin D and the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, to determine the statistical correlation between them in leprosy patients before and post-six months of multidrug therapy (MDT), household contacts, and healthy individuals. Previous studies associated these molecules with high risks to develop mycobacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis and leprosy. A total of 34 leprosy patients <span>[paucibacillary (n = 14), multibacillary (n = 20)]</span>, and 25 household contacts were recruited. Eighteen healthy adults were selected as a control group. Serum concentrations of vitamin D (25(OH)VD3) and cathelicidin were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, respectively. There were no significant differences in serum levels of 25(OH)VD3 between all groups, and the overall prevalence rate of vitamin D deficiency was 67.1%. Cathelicidin levels were significantly lower in both untreated and treated patients when compared to controls and household contacts (p < 0.05). Strong correlations between hypovitaminosis D and reduced cathelicidin in untreated (r = 0.86) and post-six months of MDT (r = 0.79) leprosy patients were observed. These results suggest that vitamin D status and cathelicidin levels are strongly correlated during multidrug therapy for leprosy and nutritional supplementation from the beginning of treatment could strengthen the immune response against leprosy.

> Leprosy is also called Hansen’s disease, named after Dr. Gerhard-Henrik Armauer Hansen of Norway, the first to identify M. leprae as the bacteria that causes leprosy.

> Leprosy is only mildly contagious. Most people—approximately 95% of us—have a natural immunity to leprosy.

> Leprosy is curable with multidrug therapy (MDT). Soon after beginning MDT, patients are no longer considered contagious.

> Approximately 200,000 new cases of leprosy are reported each year.

> &nbsp; &nbsp; 50% to 66% of all new cases occur in India.

> Approximately 150 people are diagnosed with leprosy in the United States each year.

> Other than humans, armadillos are the only other animal know to host the leprosy bacillus.

> Because of the stigma associated with the disease, many do not seek treatment until the disease has progressed. It is estimated that 2 million people worldwide suffer disabilities resulting from leprosy.

> Contrary to popular belief, leprosy does not cause limbs and digits to “fall off” of the body. Instead, repeated injury and infection—as a result of loss of sensation—leads to the shortening of fingers, toes, and limbs as tissue is absorbed into the body.
