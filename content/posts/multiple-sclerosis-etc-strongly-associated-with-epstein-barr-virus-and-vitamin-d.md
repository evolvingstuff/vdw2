#### Vitamin D, Epstein-Barr virus, and endogenous retroviruses in multiple sclerosis - facts and hypotheses - March 2021

J Integr Neurosci. 2021 Mar 30;20(1):233-238. [doi: 10.31083/j.jin.2021.01.392.](https://doi.org/10.31083/j.jin.2021.01.392.)

The pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains poorly understood. Presumably, MS is caused by multiple environmental, epigenetic, and genetic factors. Among them, human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and vitamin D have been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis and course of MS. Because vitamin D can affect the immune system and infections, it can be hypothesized that there is a close interplay between vitamins, EBV and ERV in the pathogenesis of MS. Here, we summarize the important data on vitamin D, including polymorphisms in genes related to vitamin D metabolism, EBV and ERV, in the pathogenesis of MS and create hypotheses regarding their interactions. Data indicate that vitamin D has a strong impact on viral infections and interferes with EBV infection, while EBV is capable of activating silent ERVs. We believe that EBV could be the missing link between vitamin D and ERV in MS pathogenesis.

#### [Evidence for the role of a virus in MS ](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/What-Causes-MS/Viruses) National MS Org 2021

* "Ninety to ninety-five percent of people with MS have proteins in their spinal fluid that are typically found in the spinal fluid of people with nervous system diseases that are known to be reactions to viruses."

* "HHV-6 may also be involved in MS — specifically related to triggering relapses. A team in Spain found that HHV-6 antibodies reached their highest levels in people with MS two weeks before a relapse occurred. "

 **Highlights** 

* Clinical studies show that depletion of B cells reduces disease burden in both relapsing-remitting and progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

* B cell-tropic viruses may trigger aberrant immune responses in MS in genetically susceptible individuals owing, in part, to a failure in viral surveillance and clearance.

* The most compelling data supporting an etiologic role for viral involvement in MS have emerged for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV).

Targeting mechanisms by which EBV is thought to participate in MS pathogenesis provides an opportunity for new drug development in MS.

New treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) focused on B cells have created an atmosphere of excitement in the MS community. B cells are now known to play a major role in disease, demonstrated by the highly impactful effect of a B cell-depleting antibody on controlling MS. The idea that a virus may play a role in the development of MS has a long history and is supported mostly by studies demonstrating a link between B cell-tropic Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and disease onset. Efforts to develop antiviral strategies for treating MS are underway. Although gaps remain in our understanding of the etiology of MS, the role, if any, of viruses in propagating pathogenic immune responses deserves attention.

#### The role of Epstein-Barr virus in multiple sclerosis:   
from molecular pathophysiology to in vivo imaging - March 2019

Neural Regen Res. 2019 Mar; 14(3): 373–386. [doi: 10.4103/1673-5374.245462](https://doi.org/10.4103/1673-5374.245462)

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and neuronal damage. Environmental and genetic factors are associated with the risk of developing MS, but the exact cause still remains unidentified.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), vitamin D, and smoking are among the most well-established environmental risk factors in MS. 

Infectious mononucleosis, which is caused by delayed primary EBV infection, increases the risk of developing MS. 

EBV may also contribute to MS pathogenesis indirectly by activating silent human endogenous retrovirus-W. The emerging B-cell depleting therapies, particularly anti-CD20 agents such as rituximab, ocrelizumab, as well as the fully human ofatumumab, have shown promising clinical and magnetic resonance imaging benefit. One potential effect of these therapies is the depletion of memory B-cells, the primary reservoir site where EBV latency occurs. In addition, EBV potentially interacts with both genetic and other environmental factors to increase susceptibility and disease severity of MS. This review examines the role of EBV in MS pathophysiology and summarizes the recent clinical and radiological findings, with a focus on B-cells and in vivo imaging. Addressing the potential link between EBV and MS allows the better understanding of MS pathogenesis and helps to identify additional disease biomarkers that may be responsive to B-cell depleting intervention.

#### Exploring the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on the anti-EBV antibody response in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis - 2018

Background:

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection and vitamin D insufficiency are potentially interacting risk factors for multiple sclerosis (MS).

Objectives:

To investigate the effect of high-dose vitamin D3 supplements on antibody levels against the EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and to explore any underlying mechanism affecting anti-EBNA-1 antibody levels.

Methods:

This study utilized blood samples from a randomized controlled trial in RRMS patients receiving either vitamin D3 (14,000 IU/day; n = 30) or placebo (n = 23) over 48 weeks. Circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin-D, and anti-EBNA-1, anti-EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA), and anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibodies were measured. EBV load in leukocytes, EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses, and anti-EBNA-1 antibody production in vitro were also explored.

Results:

The median antibody levels against EBNA-1, but not VCA and CMV, significantly reduced in the vitamin D3 group (526 (368–1683) to 455 (380–1148) U/mL) compared to the placebo group (432 (351–1280) to 429 (297–1290) U/mL; p = 0.023). EBV load and cytotoxic T-cell responses were unaffected. Anti-EBNA-1 antibody levels remained below detection limits in B-cell cultures.

Conclusion:

High-dose vitamin D3 supplementation selectively reduces anti-EBNA-1 antibody levels in RRMS patients. Our exploratory studies do not implicate a promoted immune response against EBV as the underlying mechanism.

 **Symptoms of Epstein-Barr virus <span style="color:#F00;">fourth stage</span> – a viral inflammation may include:** 

Muscle and joint pain

Painful and tender points

Back pain

Stinging and/or numbness of the hands and feet

Migraine

Constant fatigue

Dizziness

Blurred vision

Insomnia

Restless sleep

Night sweats

Tinnitus – Or ringing in the ear, is usually caused by EBV getting into the inner ear’s nerve channel, called the labyrinth. The ringing is the result of the virus inflaming and vibrating the labyrinth and the vestibulocochlear nerve.

Vertigo and Meniere’s Disease – Vertigo and Meniere’s disease are often attributed by doctors to calcium crystals, or stones, becoming disrupted in the inner ear. However, most chronic cases are actually caused by EBV’s neurotoxin inflaming the vagus nerve.

Anxiety

Chest tightness

Chest pain

Esophageal spasms, and asthma can also be caused by EBV inflaming the vagus nerve.

Tingling and numbness in hands and feet, can be caused by phrenic nerves becoming perpetually inflamed by EBV.

And heart palpitations can result from buildup of EBV’s poisonous virus corpses and byproduct in the heart’s mitral valve.
