Vitamin D is an important hormone in vertebrates, and most animals acquire this hormone through their diet and/or exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. To date, no study has determined how chinchillas (Chinchilla laniger) acquire vitamin D. The objective of this study was to determine whether exposure to UVB radiation had an effect on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in captive chinchillas. 

Ten juvenile chinchillas were used for this scientific investigation. Baseline blood samples were collected from the animals while under isoflurane anesthesia to determine their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. The chinchillas were then randomly assigned to two treatment groups: 

* Group A, 12 hours of UVB exposure per day; and 

* Group B, no UVB exposure. 

At the end of the study (Day 16), a second blood sample was collected from each animal while again under isoflurane anesthesia to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Mean ± SD serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations differed significantly (p=0.048) between juvenile chinchillas 

* provided supplemental UVB radiation (189.0 ± 102.7 nmol/L) and those 

* not provided supplemental UVB radiation (87.8 ± 34.4 nmol/L). 

This study found that exposing juvenile chinchillas to UVB radiation significantly increased their circulating serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Because vitamin D is an essential hormone in vertebrates, these findings suggest that the provision of UVB radiation to captive chinchillas may be important. Further research to elucidate the importance of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and UVB radiation in captive chinchillas is required.
