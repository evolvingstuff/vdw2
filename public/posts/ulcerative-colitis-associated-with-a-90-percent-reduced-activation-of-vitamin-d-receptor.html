 **Note: VDR  is a log scale. log of 5.6 is 1/10 of log of 6.6** 

Background and aims: Epidemiological studies have shown that subnormal levels of vitamin D (25(OH)D) are associated with a more aggravated clinical course of ulcerative colitis (UC). Despite an increased focus on the therapeutic importance of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling, the mechanisms underlying the effects of the vitamin D-VDR axis on UC remain elusive. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether exposure to active vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3)/VDR signaling in human organoids could influence the maintenance of the colonic epithelium.

Methods: Intestinal VDR expression was studied by immunohistochemistry, RNA expression arrays, and single-cell RNA sequencing of colonic biopsy specimens obtained from patients with UC and healthy individuals. To characterize the functional and transcriptional effects of 1,25(OH)2D3, we used patient-derived colonic organoids. The dependency of VDR was assessed by knocking out the receptor with CRISPR/Cas9.

Results: Our results suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3/VDR stimulation supports differentiation of the colonic epithelium and that impaired 1,25(OH)2D3/VDR signaling thereby may compromise the structure of the intestinal epithelial barrier, leading to flares of UC. Furthermore, a transcriptional response to VDR activity was observed primarily in fully differentiated cells at the top of the colonic crypt, and this response was reduced during flares of UC.

Conclusions: We identified an important role of vitamin D signaling in supporting differentiated cell states in the human colonic epithelium, and thereby maintenance of the intestinal barrier integrity. This makes the vitamin D-VDR signaling axis an interesting target for therapeutic efforts to achieve and maintain remission in patients with UC.

Background and aims: Epidemiological studies have shown that subnormal levels of vitamin D (25(OH)D) are associated with a more aggravated clinical course of ulcerative colitis (UC). Despite an increased focus on the therapeutic importance of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling, the mechanisms underlying the effects of the vitamin D-VDR axis on UC remain elusive. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether exposure to active vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3)/VDR signaling in human organoids could influence the maintenance of the colonic epithelium.

Methods: Intestinal VDR expression was studied by immunohistochemistry, RNA expression arrays, and single-cell RNA sequencing of colonic biopsy specimens obtained from patients with UC and healthy individuals. To characterize the functional and transcriptional effects of 1,25(OH)2D3, we used patient-derived colonic organoids. The dependency of VDR was assessed by knocking out the receptor with CRISPR/Cas9.

Results: Our results suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3/VDR stimulation supports differentiation of the colonic epithelium and that impaired 1,25(OH)2D3/VDR signaling thereby may compromise the structure of the intestinal epithelial barrier, leading to flares of UC. Furthermore, a transcriptional response to VDR activity was observed primarily in fully differentiated cells at the top of the colonic crypt, and this response was reduced during flares of UC.

Conclusions: We identified an important role of vitamin D signaling in supporting differentiated cell states in the human colonic epithelium, and thereby maintenance of the intestinal barrier integrity. This makes the vitamin D-VDR signaling axis an interesting target for therapeutic efforts to achieve and maintain remission in patients with UC.
