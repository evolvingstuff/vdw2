A paltry 2,000 IU of vitamin D was given to those diagnosed with digestive tract cancers

Would have had far more benefit if they had done one or more of the following

1. Started with a Vitamin D[loading dose](/posts/overview-loading-of-vitamin-d) (e.g. 400,000 IU over a week)

1. Had used a dose size of at least 4,000 IU of vitamin D

1. Had used [less frequent than daily dosing](/posts/optimal-vitamin-d-supplementation-strategies-d3-weekly-or-monthly)

1. Had supplemented to increase the [activation of the vitamin D Receptor](/categories/vitamin-d-receptor) - such as Resveratrol

* [Risks of Colorectal Cancer, IBD, etc slightly increased if poor Vitamin D Receptor – Aug 2018](/posts/risks-of-colorectal-cancer-ibd-etc-slightly-increased-if-poor-vitamin-d-receptor)

* [Colon Cancer survival 3.1 X less likely if poor Vitamin D Receptor – Aug 2017](/posts/colon-cancer-survival-31-x-less-likely-if-poor-vitamin-d-receptor)

 **Note: Even better if had high vitamin D years before, as Vitamin D PREVENTS many cancers**
