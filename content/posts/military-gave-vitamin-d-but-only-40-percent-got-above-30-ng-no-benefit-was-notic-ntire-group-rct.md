#### High dose vitamin D supplementation decreases the risk of deficiency in male conscripts, but has no effect on physical performance-A randomized study

J Exp Orthop  2024 May 1;11(3):e12023. [doi: 10.1002/jeo2.12023.](https://doi.org/10.1002/jeo2.12023.) eCollection 2024 Jul.

Purpose: Physical load during military training might increase the need for vitamin D; therefore, supplementation could be beneficial for 25(OH)D serum levels and physical performance.

Methods: One hundred and twelve male conscripts were randomized into two vitamin D oil capsule supplementation groups: 55 participants in the 600 IU group and 57 in the 4000 IU group with a follow-up period from July 2021 to May 2022. Physical fitness tests were performed in July, October and May. Hand grip strength tests were performed in July, October and January. Blood serum (25(OH)D), parathyroid hormone PTH), calcium and ionized calcium (i-Ca) values were measured in July, October, January and May.

Results: The 600 IU group had a lower (p < 0.001) value of 25(OH)D at all time points compared to the 4000 IU group, except at baseline. None of the subjects in the 600 IU group reached sufficient levels of 75 nmol/L of 25(OH)D in January and May. In May, 60% of participants in the 600 IU group and 30% in the 4000 IU group had 25(OH)D levels under 50 nmol/L. No significant differences in PTH or i-Ca values were found between the study groups at any time point. No significant differences at any time point were found in the physical fitness test or hand grip strength test between the groups.

Conclusion: A 10-month vitamin D supplementation with 4000 IU decreased the incidence of vitamin D deficiency (<75 nmol/L) in young, male army conscripts during wintertime, but no differences in physical performance were found compared to 600 IU supplementation.

!!!!High dose vitamin D supplementation decreases the risk of deficiency in male conscripts, but has no effect on physical performance-A randomized study
J Exp Orthop  2024 May 1;11(3):e12023. doi: 10.1002/jeo2.12023. eCollection 2024 Jul.
Leho Rips 1 2 3, Alar Toom 4, Rein Kuik 1, Ahti Varblane 3, Hanno Mölder 5, Ragnar Kibur 5, Marika Laidvere 5 6, Mart Kull 7, Jüri-Toomas Kartus 1 2 8, Helena Gapeyeva 9, Madis Rahu 1 2

{img type=&quot;attId&quot; attId=&quot;21153&quot; width=&quot;750&quot;}
Purpose: Physical load during military training might increase the need for vitamin D; therefore, supplementation could be beneficial for 25(OH)D serum levels and physical performance.

Methods: One hundred and twelve male conscripts were randomized into two vitamin D oil capsule supplementation groups: 55 participants in the 600 IU group and 57 in the 4000 IU group with a follow-up period from July 2021 to May 2022. Physical fitness tests were performed in July, October and May. Hand grip strength tests were performed in July, October and January. Blood serum (25(OH)D), parathyroid hormone PTH), calcium and ionized calcium (i-Ca) values were measured in July, October, January and May.

Results: The 600 IU group had a lower (p &lt; 0.001) value of 25(OH)D at all time points compared to the 4000 IU group, except at baseline. None of the subjects in the 600 IU group reached sufficient levels of 75 nmol/L of 25(OH)D in January and May. In May, 60% of participants in the 600 IU group and 30% in the 4000 IU group had 25(OH)D levels under 50 nmol/L. No significant differences in PTH or i-Ca values were found between the study groups at any time point. No significant differences at any time point were found in the physical fitness test or hand grip strength test between the groups.
