Practitioners knowledgeable about the evidence base behind common integrative approaches can help patients attain improved quality of life, and at times, improved survival. Evidence-based recommendations include the following:</p><ul><li><p>a plant-based diet for general health after diagnosis, and</p></li><li><p>carbohydrate restriction for patients with estrogen receptor-positive postmenopausal breast cancer may be prudent.</p></li><li><p>Other dietary recommendations include a 13-h daily overnight fast. Carefully selected patients may choose to fast the day before and the day of chemotherapy to decrease side effects.</p></li></ul><p>Specific food recommendations include</p><ul><li>avoidance or limitation of alcohol, and liberal culinary use of cruciferous vegetables, coffee, green tea, soy, and flaxseed.</li></ul><p>Promising supplements include diindolylmethane and melatonin.</p><p>Omega 3 fatty acids may help with bone density in patients on aromatase inhibitors, but may increase chemotherapy resistance.</p><p>Findings regarding the usefulness of multivitamins, <strong>vitamin D</strong> , vitamin C, and vitamin E are <strong>weak and/or mixed</strong></p><p>different exercise modalities may have different effects and thus play different roles in breast cancer therapy. Aerobic and resistance training combined during breast cancer chemotherapy may confer a survival benefit, while yoga may improve outcome in lymphedema patients.</p><p>Current evidence suggests that meditation, yoga, breathing, music therapy, guided imagery, and hypnosis may improve mood and quality of life during breast cancer treatment.</p><p>Acupuncture is useful for treating side effects of breast cancer therapies, including hot flushes, aromatase inhibitor-induced joint pain, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and vulvodynia.</p><p>Vaginal moisturizers and vaginal rings supplying low-dose estrogen can be useful in the treatment of symptoms of estrogen-deprivation states caused by breast cancer treatments; such symptoms include vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and sexual dysfunction. Carbon dioxide laser technology can rejuvenate atrophied vaginal mucosa and relieve dyspareunia, allowing avoidance of estrogen therapy.
