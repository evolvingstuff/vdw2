25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> is a marker with an important role in regulating the inflammatory response. Low concentrations of this vitamin are often found among the population, correlated with increased risk of respiratory tract infections. The aim of the study is to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D levels and clinical and laboratory markers in children and adolescents hospitalized with and without COVID-19. A retrospective study, including all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 and having vitamin D measured, was performed. All included hospital­ized cases, 78 COVID-19 patients and 162 NonCOVID-19 patients, were divided into subgroups according to their 25(OH)D serum levels (<20 ng/mL—deficiency, 20-30 ng/mL—insufficiency, >30 ng/mL—normal or <30 ng/mL, >30 ng/mL) and age (<2 years, >2 years). Vitamin D defi­ciency and insufficiency increased with age, in both COVID-19 and NonCOVID-19 groups. All symptoms were encountered more frequently in cases of pediatric patients with COVID-19 in com­parison with NonCOVID-19 cases. The most frequently encountered symptoms in the COVID-19 group were fever, loss of appetite, and nasal congestion. In the NonCOVID-19 group, serum 25(OH)D concentrations were positively correlated with leukocytes, lymphocytes, and LMR and negatively correlated with neutrophils, NLR, and PLR while no significant correlation was observed in the case of COVID-19 group. Differences between vitamin D status and clinical and laboratory parameters were observed, but their clinical significance should be interpreted with caution. The results of this study may offer further support for future studies exploring the mechanisms of the relationship between vitamin D and clinical and laboratory markers as well as for studies investigating the im­plications of vitamin D deficiency/supplementation on overall health/clinical outcomes of patients with/without COVID-19.

25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is a marker with an important role in regulating the inflammatory response. Low concentrations of this vitamin are often found among the population, correlated with increased risk of respiratory tract infections. The aim of the study is to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D levels and clinical and laboratory markers in children and adolescents hospitalized with and without COVID-19. A retrospective study, including all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 and having vitamin D measured, was performed. All included hospital­ized cases, 78 COVID-19 patients and 162 NonCOVID-19 patients, were divided into subgroups according to their 25(OH)D serum levels (&lt;20 ng/mL—deficiency, 20-30 ng/mL—insufficiency, &gt;30 ng/mL—normal or &lt;30 ng/mL, &gt;30 ng/mL) and age (&lt;2 years, &gt;2 years). Vitamin D defi­ciency and insufficiency increased with age, in both COVID-19 and NonCOVID-19 groups. All symptoms were encountered more frequently in cases of pediatric patients with COVID-19 in com­parison with NonCOVID-19 cases. The most frequently encountered symptoms in the COVID-19 group were fever, loss of appetite, and nasal congestion. In the NonCOVID-19 group, serum 25(OH)D concentrations were positively correlated with leukocytes, lymphocytes, and LMR and negatively correlated with neutrophils, NLR, and PLR while no significant correlation was observed in the case of COVID-19 group. Differences between vitamin D status and clinical and laboratory parameters were observed, but their clinical significance should be interpreted with caution. The results of this study may offer further support for future studies exploring the mechanisms of the relationship between vitamin D and clinical and laboratory markers as well as for studies investigating the im­plications of vitamin D deficiency/supplementation on overall health/clinical outcomes of patients with/without COVID-19.
