Background: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and hypertension. Vitamin D deficiency activates the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, which affects the cardiovascular system. For this reason, it could be suggested that there is a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and atrial fibrillation (AF). In our study, we compared 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels between nonvalvular AF, valvular AF, and control groups in sinus rhythm. 

Method: A total of 102 patients with nonvalvular chronic AF without any other cardiovascular disease (mean age 62.51 ± 5.88; group I) and 96 patients with AF, which is associated with mitral valve disease (mean age 61.51 ± 5; group II) were included in our study. Of all, 100 age-matched healthy people with sinus rhythm were accepted as control groups (mean age 61.35 ± 5.44). Routine biochemical parameters, 25-OHD and parathormone levels were performed. 

Results: Baseline characteristics of the study groups were comparable. Group I patients had a lower vitamin D level than group II and the control group (6.51 ± 4.89, 9.24 ± 7.39, and 11.18 ± 6.98 ng/mL, P &amp;lt; .001, respectively). In groups I and II, the patients’ left atrium diameter and systolic pulmonary artery pressure are higher than the control group. 

Conclusion: As a result, our study revealed a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and nonvalvular AF.

!Vitamin D, UV, and skin cancer in the elderly: to expose or not to expose?
Glossmann H.
Gerontology. 2011;57(4):350-3. Epub 2010 Dec 22.
Institute for Biochemical Pharmacology, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria. Hartmut.Glossmann@i-med.ac.at

There is mounting concern about vitamin D insufficiency, especially in the ageing population. Increases in indoor lifestyle, obesity, car travel, clothing habits, the use of photo-protective makeup, and campaigns driven by dermatologists, governments, and the cosmetic industry to avoid or protect against the sun as much as possible are contributing to this trend. 

In a recent article in Gerontology, Barysch et al. [1] recommend that the ageing population avoid any &amp;#39;intentional&amp;#39; UV radiation as well as &amp;#39;minimize sun exposure&amp;#39; based on known dangers of developing skin cancer. They warn that &amp;#39;studies with vitamin D supplements reported increased risks of prostate and esophagus cancer as well as atopy in childhood&amp;#39; and concluded that &amp;#39;adequate levels of vitamin D are essential for the elderly&amp;#39;, but do not suggest which level is optimal. I will argue that the ageing population should keep their serum 25-(OH)-vitamin D(3) (25-(OH)-D) levels in the 75-100 nmol/l range. An oral cholecalciferol intake of ?2,000 IU/day is recommended as a supplement throughout the year for those who cannot enjoy the sun in summer or only during &amp;#39;vitamin D winter&amp;#39; for the others.

!!Interesting statements in the paper
*Intense (with sunburns) and intermittent (vacation or weekend) UVR exposure, especially in early childhood, predispose to MM
*The MM risk of the trunk and limbs increases with a higher socioeconomic status (more recreational, intermittent sun exposure) but is surprisingly largely uninfluenced by latitude and ambient UV-B radiation [15]
*. . the incidence has been rising continuously since as early as 1940, but this increase has mainly occurred in indoor but not outdoor workers. . .
*. .higher 25-(OH)-D levels at the time of diagnosis are associated with both thinner tumors and better survival . . .
*’Nitric oxide production in the skin is increased at the same time by UV-A, which lowers the system blood pressure, indicating that there are many activities of natural sunlight extending beyond vitamin D
*Are your chances of dying – compared to a population without BCC or SCC – better or worse? 
+The answer is surprising and unexpected: 
+you are going to live longer, by ~9%, if you have been diagnosed with a BCC based on a 10–year mortality rate ratio (MRR = 0.91)

&lt;p>&lt;strong>15 reasons to think that schizophrenia is associated with low vitamin D&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>97% of patients with schizophrenia are vitamin D deficient&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Schizophrenia varies with latitude (UVB) by 10X (controversy)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Schizophrenia is more common in those with dark skin (when away from the equator)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Schizophrenia is associated with low natal vitamin D&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Schizophrenia has been increasing around the world when vitamin D has been decreasing (controversy)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

We determined total 25(OH)D using the LIASON® 25 OH Vitamin D kit (DiaSorin Inc., Stillwater MN, USA). We evaluated VF with a computerized analysis of scanned L-L vertebral X-rays (T4 to L5). Reduction of &amp;gt; 20% of vertebral body height was considered a VF, while reductions between 15% and 20% were considered borderline fractures (BF). Fracture severity was estimated as mild, moderate or severe (reduction: 20–25%, 25–40% or &amp;gt;40%, respectively). VC assessments were also centralized. Witteman’s method (Lancet, 1994) was used for blinded assessments in duplicate. VC were quantified by measuring the length of calcific deposits along the anterior and posterior wall of the aorta (mild 0.1-5 cm, moderate 5.1-10 cm and severe &amp;gt;10 cm). We also evaluated the presence or absence of calcifications of the iliac arteries in the same radiograph (mild 0.1-3 cm, moderate 3.1-5 cm and severe &amp;gt;5cm).

!!!ASSOCIATION OF CALCIFEDIOL LEVELS WITH VERTEBRAL FRACTURES, VASCULAR CALCIFICATIONS AND MORTALITY.

The best biomarker of Vitamin D status is calcifediol [25(OH)D]. We investigated the relationship between serum calcifediol levels and vertebral fractures (VF), vascular calcifications (VC) and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Within a multicenter, cross-sectional study in 18 hospital based dialysis centers in Italy, we included 387 hemodialysis patients (143 F, 37% ; 244 M, 63%), mean age 64±14 (SD) years, median dialytic age 49 months, BMI 25± 4 Kg/m2. We determined total 25(OH)D using the LIASON® 25 OH Vitamin D kit (DiaSorin Inc., Stillwater MN, USA). We evaluated VF with a computerized analysis of scanned L-L vertebral X-rays (T4 to L5). Reduction of &amp;gt; 20% of vertebral body height was considered a VF, while reductions between 15% and 20% were considered borderline fractures (BF). Fracture severity was estimated as mild, moderate or severe (reduction: 20–25%, 25–40% or &amp;gt;40%, respectively). VC assessments were also centralized. Witteman’s method (Lancet, 1994) was used for blinded assessments in duplicate. VC were quantified by measuring the length of calcific deposits along the anterior and posterior wall of the aorta (mild 0.1-5 cm, moderate 5.1-10 cm and severe &amp;gt;10 cm). We also evaluated the presence or absence of calcifications of the iliac arteries in the same radiograph (mild 0.1-3 cm, moderate 3.1-5 cm and severe &amp;gt;5cm). Any differences in VC were resolved by consensus. Follow up was 2.7±0.5 years. 

Bone markers were: Ca 9.15±0.68 mg/dl, P 4.8± 1.28 mg/dl, median ALP 83 U/L and median PTH 244 pg/ml. We found a median 25(OH)D level of 28.9 ng/ml. Nine ( 2.3%) patients had vitamin D deficiency (&amp;lt;10 ng/ml), 198 (51.2%) patients had vitamin D insufficiency (between 10-29.9 ng/ml) and 180 (46.5%) patients had normal levels ( &amp;gt;30 ng/ml). We found that 55% of patients had VF and 30.9% of patients had BF. Prevalence of VC was 80.6% (mild 20.1%, moderate 30.8%, severe 29.7%) in the aorta and 55,1% in the iliac arteries. Males had more VF than Females (60% versus 48%, P=0.019).

No associations were found between VF and biochemical parameters including calcifediol levels (p=0.662), 
while we found an association between low calcifediol levels and a higher prevalence of severe aortic calcifications (36.8 vs 28.2, p=0.0044). 

Furthermore, we found a __OR 1.85__ (1.04-3.29 CI, p=0.0367) for Aortic Calcification in patients with calcifediol levels lower than the median value of 29 ng/ml. 

During follow-up (2.7±0.5 years) mortality was of 19.9%. 

No association was found between mortality and calcifediol levels (p=0.5394). 

In conclusion, despite good control of bone and mineral metabolism parameters, hemodialysis patients showed high prevalence of VF and VC. Our study suggests that high calcifediol levels could be protective against progression of severe aortic calcification
