Clinical symptoms and lung function of CF may be influenced by correcting essential fatty acids (EFA) deficiency. Nevertheless, the value of EFA supplementation in CF remains controversial.

Objectives: The aim of this longitudinal randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was to assess the benefits of an oral supplementation with omega-3 on clinical and nutritional status, lung function and exercise tolerance.

Methods: A supplementation with a triglyceride source of omega-3 (Omega 3 Premium®, Laboratoires Ponroy, France) at a daily dose of 60 mg/kg during 1 year was administered to ΔF508 homozygous CF patients above 5 years of age. Patients were assessed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Lung function was performed at each visit and an exercise test before and at the end of study.

Results: Of the 16 patients included, 13 completed the study. Six received omega-3 and 7 the placebo. Compared to the control group the cumulative duration of antibiotic therapy decreased in the intervention group at 9 months (24.5 days vs 46.0 days, p = 0.02) and at 12 months (26.5 days vs 65.0 days, p<0.02). Compared to the previous year the number of exacerbations at 12 months decreased (1.7 vs 3.5, p<0.01) and also the cumulative duration of antibiotic therapy (26.5 days vs 60.5 days, p<0.02). No difference was observed in lung function and exercise test. Supplementation was well tolerated.

Conclusions: This longitudinal randomized placebo-controlled study shows some clinical benefits of long-term omega-3 supplementation in CF patients. However, additional studies with larger populations are needed.
