 **Update by Dr. Matthews - Sept 2018** 

In 2012, I told military generals that vitamin D deficiency (the most common nutritional deficiency in the world) is a national security threat, readiness issue, associated with rising military healthcare costs (Tricare), and the loss of  very talented soldiers from stress fractures. In 2012, stress fractures in basic and advanced military training cost the Department of Defense (DOD) over $100 million and rising every year.  **I also coined  the term, “super soldier”**  which is a soldier that can handle more stress during training and combat with fewer injuries, faster recovery from injuries, and better cognitive performance under stress.

The military convinced the government to start a “free lunch program’ in the early 1940’s during World War II because most American teenagers were malnourished and this diminished military readiness. History is repeating itself.  **Hopefully,  the rest of the country and the world will follow the military’s lead once again, and address the most common nutritional deficiency in the world** . You simply can not have optimal health with the majority of soldiers and U.S. citizens having low vitamin D levels. I humbly thank the military leaders/generals for simply listening and addressing this worldwide epidemic.

#### [Natick’s Performance Readiness Bar](http://soldiersystems.net/2018/09/10/naticks-performance-readiness-bar/) Sept 2018

* “Data is being collected and analyzed from 4,000 recruits who consume the PRB in order to determine exactly how such a supplement affects their performance during Basic Combat Training and into the first four years of their service.”

* “The Air Force is also conducting a similar study, with Special Warfare candidates offered nutritional supplements.”

#### 1,000 Vitamin D + Calcium snack bar helped military training in summer a bit - RCT March 2019

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Comment by VitaminDWiki: 1,000 IU is a very small amount</span>** 

 **Calcium and vitamin D supplementation and bone health in Marine recruits: Effect of season.**

Stress fractures are common overuse injuries caused by repetitive bone loading. These fractures are of particular concern for military recruits and athletes resulting in attrition in up to 60% of recruits that sustain a fracture. Army and Navy recruits supplemented with daily calcium and vitamin D (Ca + D) demonstrated improved bone strength and reduced stress fractures. The aim of the current study was to evaluate whether Ca + D supplementation improves measures of bone health in recruits undergoing United States Marine Corps initial military training (IMT), and whether the effect of supplementation on indices of bone health varied by season. 

One-hundred ninety-seven Marine recruits (n = 107 males, n = 90 females, mean age = 18.9 ± 1.6 y) were randomized to receive either Ca + D fortified snack bars (2000 mg Ca and 1000 IU vitamin D per day) or placebo divided into twice daily doses during 12 weeks of IMT. Anthropometrics, fasted blood samples, and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) scans of the tibial metaphysis and diaphysis were collected upon entrance to- and post-training (12 weeks later). Half of the volunteers entered training in July and the other half started in February. Time-by-group interactions were observed for vitamin D status (25OHD) and the bone turnover markers, BAP, TRAP and OCN. 25OHD increased and BAP, TRAP and OCN all decreased in the Ca + D group (p < .05). Training increased distal tibia volumetric BMD (+1.9 ± 2.8%), BMC (+2.0 ± 3.1%), and bone strength index (BSI; +4.0 ± 4.0%) and diaphyseal BMC (+1.0 ± 2.2%) and polar stress strain index (SSIp; +0.7 ± 2.1%) independent of Ca + D supplementation (p < .05 for all). When analyzed by season, change in BSI was 67% greater in the Ca + D group as compared to placebo in the summer iteration only (T*G; p < .05). When categorized by tertile of percent change in BSI, recruits demonstrating the greatest changes in BSI and 25OHD entered training with the lowest levels of 25OHD (p < .05). Taken together, these data suggest that Ca + D supplementation reduced indices of bone turnover and the decline in 25OHD over training in volunteers that started training in the summer was prevented by supplementation. Baseline 25OHD and trajectory may be important for optimizing skeletal health during IMT.

#### 1000 IU Vitamin D appears to have less benefit than summer vs winter military training much - RCT May 2019

 **Effects of vitamin D supplementation on salivary immune responses during Marine Corps basic training.**

Vitamin D's role in regulating immune responses may increase during periods of elevated psychological and physiological stress. Due to the high demands placed on US Marine Corps recruits undergoing 12 weeks of basic military training, we hypothesized that vitamin status would be related to markers of innate mucosal immunity, and daily vitamin D supplementation would augment immune responses during training. Males (n = 75) and females (n = 74) entering recruit basic training during the summer and winter volunteered to participate in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects received either 1000 IU vitamin D3 + 2000 mg calcium·d-1 (n = 73) or placebo (n = 76) for 12-weeks. Saliva samples were collected pre-, during (weeks 4 and 8), and post-training (week 12) for measurement of salivary SIgA and cathelicidin (indices of mucosal immunity) and stress (α-amylase). Initial (baseline) and post-training serum 25(OH)D levels were assessed. Results were as follows: Serum 25(OH)D levels were 37% higher in recruits entering training in summer compared to winter. A positive relationship was observed between baseline 25(OH)D levels and SIgA-secretion rates (-SR). When stress levels were high during summer training, baseline 25(OH)D levels contributed to an increase in SIgA-SR and cathelicidin-SR, the latter only in males. Vitamin D supplementation contributed to the changes in SIgA-SR and cathelicidin-SR, specifically SIgA-SR was higher in the treatment group. These data highlight the importance of vitamin D and mucosal immune responses during arduous basic military training when stress levels are increased.
