D3 (cholecalciferol) once a month for 12 consecutive months. The serum Vit. D levels and lipid profiles were measured at baseline, 3rd, 6th, and 12th months after the intervention. Participants were categorized based on Vit. D level at baseline into deficiency (&amp;lt; 20 ng/mL), inadequate (20-30 ng/mL), and adequate (&amp;gt; 30 ng/mL) groups, and the data were compared at different times between the three groups.\n\nResults: Three deficiency (n = 73), inadequate (n = 138) and adequate (n = 134) groups of participants were followed. In all participants the average amount of Vit. D level changes were 8 ng/mL after one year of supplementation. The mean changes of serum Vit. D level in 6th and 12th months vs. 3th month was as below: In deficiency group: 4.08 ± 0.85 and 10.01 ± 1.02 ng/mL; (p &amp;lt; 0.001), in inadequate group: 3.07 ± 0.59 and 7.26 ± 0.78 ng/mL; (p = 0.001) and in adequate group: 2.02 ± 0.88 and 6.44 ± 1.005 ng/ml; (p = 0.001). Lipid profiles were improved in three groups. So, the mean changes of lipid profiles at the end of the study comparing with the baseline were: -5.86 ± 2.09, -7.22 ± 1.43 and - 6.17 ± 1.72 (mg/dl) for LDL (p &amp;lt; 0.05); -12.24 ± 3.08, -13.64 ± 3.21 and - 17.81 ± 2.94 (mg/dl) for cholesterol (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in deficiency, inadequate and adequate groups, respectively. For triglyceride, the mean changes were - 13.24 ± 5.78 and - 15.85 ± 7.49 (mg/dl) in deficiency and adequate groups, respectively (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Although the triglyceride decreased in the inadequate group at the end of the study but this difference was not significant (p = 0.67).\n\nConclusion: Taking of 50,000 IU Vit. D 3 monthly for 12 months resulted in reaching its level to adequate level in both deficiency and insufficient groups; however, in the adequate group its level did not reach above than 50 ng/mL. Therefore, 50,000 IU Vit. D3 supplementation monthly for one year can have beneficial effects on lipid profiles and there is no risk of toxicity in healthy women.\n`

Background: Recently, Serum vitamin D (Vit. D) levels evaluation and the use of Vit. D supplements have increased substantially. There is no specific guideline for the duration of Vit. D supplementation, so yet Vit. D supplementation duration has remained a critical and controversial issue. This study aimed to determine the vit. D supplementation duration to reach an adequate or optimal Vit. D status and its effect on lipid profile.

Methods: In this longitudinal study, __345 women__ with different status of Vit. D levels were enrolled and followed up for one year. Eligible participants received 50,000 IU Vit.

Participants were categorized based on Vit.

So, the mean changes of lipid profiles at the end of the study comparing with the baseline were: -5.86 ± 2.09, -7.22 ± 1.43 and - 6.17 ± 1.72 (mg/dl) for LDL (p &amp;lt; 0.05); -12.24 ± 3.08, -13.64 ± 3.21 and - 17.81 ± 2.94 (mg/dl) for cholesterol (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in deficiency, inadequate and adequate groups, respectively. For triglyceride, the mean changes were - 13.24 ± 5.78 and - 15.85 ± 7.49 (mg/dl) in deficiency and adequate groups, respectively (p &amp;lt; 0.05).
