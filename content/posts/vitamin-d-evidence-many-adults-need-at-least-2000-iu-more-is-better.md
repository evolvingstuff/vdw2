#### Vitamin D: Evidence-Based Health Benefits and Recommendations for Population Guidelines

Nutrients 2025, 17(2), 277; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17020277

Vitamin D offers numerous under-recognized health benefits beyond its well-known role in musculoskeletal health. It is vital for extra-renal tissues, prenatal health, brain function, immunity, pregnancy, cancer prevention, and cardiovascular health. Existing guidelines issued by governmental and health organizations are bone-centric and largely overlook the abovementioned extra-skeletal benefits and optimal thresholds for vitamin D. In addition, they rely on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which seldom show benefits due to high baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations, moderate supplementation doses, and flawed study designs. This review emphasizes the findings from prospective cohort studies showing that higher 25(OH)D concentrations reduce the risks of major diseases and mortality, including pregnancy and birth outcomes. 

Serum concentrations > 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) significantly lower disease and mortality risks compared to <20 ng/mL. With 25% of the U.S. population and 60% of Central Europeans having levels <20 ng/mL, concentrations should be raised above 30 ng/mL. 

This is achievable through daily supplementation with 2000 IU/day (50 mcg/day) of vitamin D3, which prevent diseases and deaths. 

Furthermore, a daily dose between 4000 and 6000 IU of vitamin D3 to achieve serum 25(OH)D levels between 40 and 70 ng/mL would provide greater protection against many adverse health outcomes. Future guidelines and recommendations should integrate the findings from observational prospective cohort studies and well-designed RCTs to improve public health and personalized care.

#### Summary of study by [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/please-summarize-the-attached-N_VhWAstThms57mfNzk5Og)

This comprehensive review examines the evidence-based health benefits of vitamin D 

&nbsp; &nbsp;and recommendations for population guidelines. 

Here are the key findings:

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Health Benefits</span>** 

 **Cardiovascular Disease** 

* Higher vitamin D levels significantly reduce cardiovascular disease risk and mortality

* Raising serum vitamin D above 40 ng/mL can lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients

 **Cancer Prevention** 

* Vitamin D reduces cancer incidence and mortality through multiple mechanisms

* Higher vitamin D levels (>60 ng/mL) associated with 80% lower breast cancer risk

* Benefits seen for colorectal, prostate, lung and other cancers

 **Immune Function** 

* Enhances innate and adaptive immunity

* Reduces risk of respiratory infections including COVID-19

* Helps prevent autoimmune conditions

 **Other Key Benefits** 

* Reduces risk of diabetes and improves glycemic control

* Supports brain health and reduces dementia risk

* Improves pregnancy outcomes and reduces complications

* Essential for bone health and dental health

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Recommendations</span>** 

 **Optimal Blood Levels** 

* Minimum recommended level: 30 ng/mL

* Optimal range: 40-70 ng/mL for most health benefits

* Higher levels (80-150 ng/mL) may benefit certain conditions under medical supervision

 **Supplementation** 

* Minimum recommendation: 2,000 IU/day for most adults

* 4,000-6,000 IU/day needed to achieve optimal blood levels

* Higher doses may be required for obesity, certain health conditions

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Limitations of Current Guidelines</span>** 

The review critiques the 2024 Endocrine Society guidelines for:

* Being too conservative in dosing recommendations

* Overlooking extensive evidence from observational studies

* Focusing primarily on bone health while ignoring broader benefits

* Not accounting for individual variations in vitamin D metabolism

The authors conclude that raising population vitamin D levels 

* could significantly reduce the incidence and mortality rates for 8 of the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S.

* as well as improve various health outcomes.
