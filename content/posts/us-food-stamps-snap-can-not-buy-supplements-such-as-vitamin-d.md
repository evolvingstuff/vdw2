#### [Mister: Congress should put more nutrition in the  **Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program** ](https://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/mister-congress-should-put-more-nutrition-in-the-supplemental-nutrition/article_2e6e8ad4-e83c-5d63-8f42-891a8e37559f.html)

* “Mister is president and CEO of the Council for Responsible Nutrition”

* “About 40 million low-income Americans rely on SNAP benefits to afford food”

* “Right now, SNAP benefits can be used to purchase virtually any food — but they can’t be used to buy multivitamins. That makes no sense”

* “Multivitamins aren’t a substitute for food or a magic bullet that sanctions unhealthy diets. But in a world where all of us — low-income families in particular — don’t eat like we should, multivitamins are a scientifically-proven way to help individuals meet nutritional requirements.”
