Schnieders and her colleagues wanted to find out whether this, as well as other factors like vitamin D deficiency, might explain the fatigue commonly seen after traumatic brain injury.</p><p>The researchers randomly selected 100 former patients of their rehabilitation center to participate in the study, and 90 agreed (26 females and 64 males).</p><p>It had been about 10 years since the <strong>traumatic brain injuries</strong> .</p><p>All filled out a fatigue questionnaire and provided information on emotional well-being, quality of life, attention, coping style, daily activity, and physical performance as assessed on a cycling test. The researchers also measured vitamin D levels.</p><p>Slightly more than half (51%) of the patients reported being severely fatigued. As expected, these patients had more anxiety and a lower quality of life.</p><p>Deficiency in at least one of the pituitary hormones was identified in 29%, growth hormone deficiency was found in 24%, and gonadal hormone deficiency was observed in 10%. None of these deficiencies was significantly related to fatigue.</p><p>In a multivariate analysis including hormone deficiencies, vitamin D deficiency, sleep problems, attention, body mass index, and gender, vitamin D deficiency was the only factor independently associated with fatigue (P&lt;0.05).</p><p>It is unclear why sleep problems strengthened the negative effect of vitamin D deficiency on fatigue, but Schnieders said there is some evidence linking melatonin, which is involved in regulating circadian rhythms, and vitamin D.</p><p>The observational study could not prove that vitamin D deficiency was causing the fatigue.</p><p>Schnieders said another possible explanation for the findings could be that fatigued patients are more likely to remain inside and not get enough exposure to sunlight.</p><p>&ldquo;But I think it has something to do with the immunological system because both sleep and vitamin D are involved in the immunological system,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Schnieders reported no conflicts of interest.</p><p>Primary source: European Congress of Endocrinology</p><p>Schnieders J, et al &ldquo;Hormonal and non-hormonal factors contributing to chronic fatigue in traumatic brain injury patients&rdquo; ECE 2010; Abstract P559.</p><h2 id=action-points--for-continuing-education>Action Points (for continuing education)</h2><ul><li><p>Explain to interested patients that this observational study could not prove a causal relationship between vitamin D deficiency and fatigue in patients who had suffered a traumatic brain injury.</p></li><li><p>Explain that the researchers did recommend that patients and physicians consider vitamin D levels and sleep problems when looking at ways to combat fatigue in traumatic brain injury patients.</p></li><li><p>Note that this study was published as an abstract and presented at a conference.
