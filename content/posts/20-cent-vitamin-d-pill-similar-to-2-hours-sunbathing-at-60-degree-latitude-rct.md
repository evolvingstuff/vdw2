#### About 2,000 IU Vitamin D daily  
= 50,000 IU vitamin D pill costing 20 cents, taken once per month.  Example:  [Bio-Tech on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Bio-Tech-D3-50-000-100-caps/dp/B000A0F2B2/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1394902278&sr=1-1&keywords=bio-tech+d3-50+50000+iu+100+caps)  
 = 2 hours of sunbathing (summer, light skin, young, not obese, etc)   
= 8 tanning bed sessions (same as sunbathing, without the seasonal restriction)

#### Note: most people need > 2,000 IU daily

#### Effect of vitamin D supplementation and ultraviolet B exposure on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in healthy volunteers:   
a randomized, crossover clinical trial.

Br J Dermatol. 2013 Aug;169(2):434-40. [doi: 10.1111/bjd.12349.](https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.12349.)

BACKGROUND:

Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation during the summer and vitamin D supplementation are two major sources of vitamin D for humans at northern latitudes. However, little is known about the relative efficiency of these two vitamin D sources.

OBJECTIVES:

The main goal was to compare the efficiency of high-dose oral vitamin D3 supplementation (2000 IU per day for 30 days) with a simulated summer UV exposure <span>[10 sunbed sessions to a total dose of 23·8 standard erythema doses (SED)]</span> to improve vitamin D status.

METHODS:

Healthy volunteers were randomized into two groups: group 1 received vitamin D supplementation followed by 10 whole-body sunbed exposures; group 2 started with 10 sunbed exposures followed by vitamin D supplementation.

RESULTS:

The oral supplementation with vitamin D3 resulted in a mean (SEM) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> increase of 25·3 (5·4) nmol L(-1) . A similar increase, 19·8 (5·4) nmol L(-1) , was observed after simulated summer UV exposure. At the end of the study, serum 25(OH)D concentrations were similar in both groups.

CONCLUSIONS:

Twice-weekly whole-body sunbed exposure to a dose of 4·8 SED is equal to 2000 IU daily of oral vitamin D supplementation for 30 days and enough to achieve and maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations > 75 nmol L(-1) in ~55% of cases. Based on our calculations, this dose corresponds to a cumulative weekly whole-body exposure of 3·4 SED (~ 40 min around midday during the summer at the latitude of Oslo).
