I'm really delighted to have Dr Michael Holick and Dr JoAnn Manson join us today.

He was the first to identify the major circulating form of vitamin D in human blood as 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Over the past four decades, he's led many of the studies demonstrating the benefits of vitamin D and is responsible for bringing vitamin D to the radar of healthcare professionals.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000>Dr JoAnn Manson is another luminary in the field and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.

I'm going to start by asking Dr Holick a question. You have shown throughout your career that vitamin D has a variety of health benefits, ranging from being anti-cancer to improving blood sugar, to enhancing immune response. Can you highlight some of these trials?</span></span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>Michael F. Holick, MD, PhD: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>Sure. We're now recognizing that vitamin D, of course, has to get activated, like you said, first in your<a href=https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI106168 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline> liver</a> to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and then in your<a href=https://doi.org/10.2215/CJN.01150308 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline> kidneys </a>to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Originally, we realized that vitamin D is really important for your <a href=https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/126.suppl_4.1159S style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline>bone health</a>. Therefore, looking at receptors for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, they were found in the intestine, bone, and kidney, which<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2017.04.008 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline> regulate calcium metabolism</a>.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000>Then we began to realize that basically<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2012.04.001 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline> every tissue and cell in your body</a> has a vitamin D receptor, and the obvious question is, why would they be there? There's now a large amount of evidence to suggest that immune cells, colon, breast, skin, and other cells in your body<a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s12018-009-9033-y style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline> can activate vitamin D locally</a>.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000>We think that it does it for the purpose of regulating cellular growth and a variety of genes. As a result, there are a multitude of association studies that have related vitamin D deficiency with increased risk for autoimmune disorders like <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06580-1 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline>type 1 diabetes</a>, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1097/MAJ.0000000000000360 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline>multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease, neurocognitive dysfunction, infectious</a><span class=Bodytext20 style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:400><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt> diseases</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, and some<a href=https://doi.org/10.1615/jenvironpatholtoxicoloncol.v28.i2.50 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline> malignancies</a>.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>Taub: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>One of the things that has come up in many of these clinical trials is the biomarker by which we measure vitamin D. I'd love to get both of your comments on what is the best biomarker to measure vitamin D levels.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>Holick: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>I don't think there's any debate about this. The only one to measure is 25-hydroxyvitamin D. It's the major circulating form of vitamin D and it's used worldwide by doctors to measure the vitamin D status of patients. The active form of vitamin D gives you no insight into your vitamin D status. It's often normal or even elevated in a vitamin D-deficient state because of <a href=https://doi.org/10.1159/000486077 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline>secondary hyperparathyroidism</a>. Only<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2007.12.001 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline> 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D </a>is useful for inborn and acquired disorders in calcium and vitamin D metabolism.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>JoAnn E. Manson, MD, DrPH, MACP: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>Yes, I agree that there really isn't controversy about that point. There are some more recently discovered biomarkers and evidence that the bioavailable and free 25-hydroxyvitamin D may provide some additional information, but the research has been quite limited, and certainly from a clinical standpoint, it would be the serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D that's the main biomarker of vitamin D status.</span></span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>Taub: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>Dr Manson, you recently led a very important landmark clinical trial, the <a href=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01169259 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline>VITAL trial</a>, and you showed that vitamin D supplementation did not reduce cardiovascular risk. But there were some other pearls from that trial on some benefits of vitamin D. Can you go over the trial with us?</span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>Manson: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>The vitamin D and omega-3 trial, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1811403 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline>VITAL</a>, is a large-scale, nationwide trial in the United States, including more than 25,000 men and women. The primary endpoints were cancer and cardiovascular disease. We found no significant reduction in total invasive cancer, nor in total cardiovascular disease.</span></span></span></span></span></p></div><div>Â </div><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000>However, we did see a strong signal for reduction in cancer death. We had a 17% reduction in cancer death that just missed being statistically significant. When we accounted for cancer latency and looked at those who had been in the trial for at least 2 years â long enough to actually have an effect on cancer death â we did see a statistically significant 25% reduction.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000>The reason this was of particular interest is that several other randomized trials had suggested that there may be an effect of vitamin D supplementation on reducing cancer death. We did a<a href=https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdz059 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline> meta-analysis</a> of five large-scale trials available looking at vitamin D supplementation and having information on cancer death. The result in the meta-analysis was of a statistically significant 13% reduction in cancer death.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000>All but one of the trials showed that the hazard ratio was on the side of benefit. Only one, bolus dosing â very high doses given monthly, given less frequently â did not show a clear reduction. There has been increasing evidence that vitamin D given daily may be of greater biological benefit than vitamin D given in very high doses and in a bolus form only once a week or once a month, or even less frequently. Some trials are testing bolus vitamin D every 3 or 6 months.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>Taub: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>In the <a href=https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/clinical-trials/2018/11/08/22/42/vital style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline>VITAL trial</a>, the average vitamin D level was around 30 <a class=wiki href=ng/mL rel>ng/mL</a>. Do you think we would have seen more of a benefit if we took people that were really vitamin D deficient, maybe levels less than 10, and then repleted them?</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>Manson: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>I think the benefits of vitamin D supplementation are greatest in those who are truly deficient. The problem is that it's not ethical to do a long-term trial in people who are known to be deficient because half of them â or close to half, usually, in most clinical trials â will be randomized to a placebo, and that means they will remain vitamin D deficient for 5 years or longer.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000>For example, the median duration of the VITAL trial was 5.3 years. Usually when we do test for vitamin D and find that someone is deficient, we want to treat them on a relatively urgent basis and not wait 5 years to let them know the results of the trial.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000>We did a trial that included a usual-risk population. Most of the trials in the United States do include people who, on average, have a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level close to 30 ng/mL, but many of the participants still do have levels below 20.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:13px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000>When these levels are measured at baseline and you're not targeting those who are deficient, then it's reasonable to just try to get a broad, generalizable group of participants and see if the results differ by baseline vitamin D status. We couldn't find strong evidence for that in VITAL, but I think that's because we did not have a very large number of people who were profoundly vitamin D deficient.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>Taub: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>Any comments on that, Dr Holick, about what level you start with and the benefit you can achieve?</span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>Holick: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>I agree with JoAnn completely. More than 50% of the VITAL participants were vitamin D sufficient. You really have to ask the question, if your vitamin D is sufficient and you're now given vitamin D, is it going to have some additional health benefit and are you going to be able to see that distinction? As Dr Manson said, she did not. To me, that was not at all a surprise.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>Manson: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>I do want to say that the goal of the VITAL trial was not to determine whether we should treat vitamin D deficiency. We know that vitamin D is essential to health and we know it's important to avoid vitamin D deficiency. The key question was whether there is a benefit of increasing vitamin D intake and supplementation beyond what is obtained in the usual US population with that type of baseline vitamin D blood level and getting, on average, maybe only 600 or even 400 IUs a day of vitamin D from various sources.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000>The question was whether giving more would reduce risk, and I think that the randomized trials do help to answer those questions. Having a neutral result by no means negates the importance of vitamin D to human health. I think it's really important that people understand that some of the disagreement may be about the amount of vitamin D we need in order to have optimal cardiovascular health or an optimal reduction in cancer risk. If anything, I do think the VITAL trial showed that more-than-usual intake of vitamin D is a benefit in reducing cancer death.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>Taub: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>Great point.

We worked with Quest Diagnostics and looked at more than 191,000 COVID- positive patients throughout all 50 states, all ages, ethnicities, and latitudes, and showed that if you have a blood level of 25- hydroxyvitamin D of 20 ng/mL compared with 34 ng/mL, you had a <a href=https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239252 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline>54% higher risk</a> of acquiring the infection. We know that vitamin D does have an important role to play in immunomodulation and that the COVID-19 infection causes the<a href=https://doi.org/10.1186/s41232-020-00146-3 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline> cytokine storm</a>.

When we looked at their baseline blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and their outcomes, there was a significant decrease in morbidity and mortality.

I think the evidence is really strong for that. I totally agree with what he said about vitamin D. There are many biological mechanisms that have been shown for vitamin D to be important in boosting immune response as well as tamping down inflammation and immune modulation, which are mechanisms that are very relevant to preventing severe COVID-19 infection.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:13px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000>However, correlation doesn't prove causation, as we say in epidemiology, which is why I know Mike believes the randomized trials are very important, and there are many potential confounders. We know that people who have low vitamin D blood levels tend to be more likely to have these<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nfs.2020.06.001 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline> comorbidities </a>that are linked to an increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness, including <a href=https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.4117 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline>diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and obesity.

One of the lessons from VITAL was that 2000 IUs today was virtually free of adverse events for 5.3 years. It had a very good safety profile. During a pandemic, why not recommend that everyone ensure they're outdoors, getting sun exposure, being physically active, as well as maybe taking a supplement of 1000 or 2000 IUs a day? I think that's quite reasonable.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:13px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000>To have conclusive evidence about causality, we need the randomized trials. So far, the randomized trials that have been done <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2020.106176 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline>have been small.

We're in the process of recruiting, with several hundred people enrolled already, and we hope to have close to 2000 participants overall. We're looking at vitamin D supplementation started right after the diagnosis: high-dose supplementation 10,000 IUs a day for 2 days as a loading dose, then 3200 IUs a day for 4 weeks. We are looking to see whether that will reduce severity of symptoms, risk for hospitalization, need for healthcare visits, and outcomes of that nature.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:13px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000>We hope to have the results at the end of this year or early 2022.

For instance, I will see a patient who has an A1 c of 5.7 or 5.9 and then they get COVID-19 and they see me a couple of months after, and their A1 c is 7.5.

They also had the same issue. Many of their subjects were vitamin D sufficient at the very beginning. I think that when patients are vitamin D sufficient and getting vitamin D, even if it may or may not have a little bit of a benefit, it dilutes the effect for those who were vitamin D deficient.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:13px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>Manson: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>We did a <a href=https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgaa335 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline>meta-analysis</a> of all of the randomized trials that have looked at progression from prediabetes to diabetes, and we are seeing a significant 12% reduction overall. It's not large. However, there is a signal that vitamin D supplementation does prevent progression to type 2 diabetes, especially if it's taken in a dose of 1000 IUs a day or more.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-right:11px;margin-bottom:14px;text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000>What was most interesting to us is that there appears to be a modifying effect of body mass index (BMI). This was found in the D2d trial as well. Vitamin D seemed to be most bioactive in those who were not in an obese BMI range. I think this needs to be better understood.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:13px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000>Those who had a BMI &lt; 30 did have a significant 29% reduction in type 2 diabetes in the D2d trial with the 4000 IUs a day if they were not in an obese BMI range. However, those with BMI > 30 didn't really have any reduction of risk. There may be something about adiposity and the inflammatory state or other factors associated with adiposity that are counteracting some of the bioactivity of vitamin D supplementation.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:13px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000>If we understood this better, we might be able to make vitamin D supplementation of benefit to everyone, regardless of BMI levels. Some of it may relate to dilution and sequestering of vitamin D, and that could be just a dose-related effect. I think it goes far beyond that because D2d tested 4000 IUs a day and did not demonstrate any benefit of the vitamin D in those with a BMI > 30, whereas they saw a very substantial benefit in those with a BMI &lt; 30.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:13px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000>We're seeing this in VITAL for a number of outcomes, including total invasive cancer. When we looked at those who started out with BMI &lt; 25, there was a statistically significant 24% reduction in the development of invasive cancer, which was our primary endpoint. At the higher BMI, we did not even see a signal for a reduction in cancer. Mike and I and his colleagues are going to be exploring further whether obesity is affecting, in any way, the gene expression signaling or the bioactivity of vitamin D, and if so, what can be done to counter that.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:13px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>Holick: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>We even saw this in our publication for the COVID-19 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eprac.2021.02.013 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline>study</a> out of our hospital.

We asked whether you can give the same dose of 25-hydroxyvitamin D â which is more water soluble, likely getting absorbed directly into the portal system rather than having to be formed into micelles, the chylomicrons, into the lymphatic system â to an obese person, a normal-weight person, and a malabsorption patient.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:13px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000>At least from our initial data, we showed that the pharmacokinetics are identical in obese and normal-weight patients and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Something that we can think about down the line is that it would be really neat as physicians to be able to give one dose that is good for all. You don't have to worry about all of these other issues and how to tailor the dose of vitamin D. It turns out that 25-hydroxyvitamin D was available as a pharmaceutical back in the 1970s and then lost favor because they said, "Why spend money for that drug when you can get vitamin D?"</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:13px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000>Â  Â  Â </span><em><span style=color:#d35400>Note:Â </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/d-velop-Vitamin-Supplements-2400-mcg/dp/B0977NKG98/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=calcidiol&amp;qid=1638462077&amp;sr=8-8"><span style=color:#d35400>US Amazon $30 for 60 capsules Dec 2021</span></a></em></span></span></span></p><p><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000>Now it's <a href=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41430-020-0558-y style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline>becoming available</a>, even in <a href=https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-1001 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline>Australia</a>, as a<a href=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41430-021-00880-y style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline> supplement over the counter</a>.

I really do think that one of the reasons why so many of the vitamin D supplementation trials, using mostly D3 but also some with D2, have not shown a benefit in the overall study population is because of this interaction with BMI. In several of these trials, those who are at healthy weight or not in the obese BMI range are seeing some benefit, even a substantial benefit, from the vitamin D supplementation. That's just not being seen in the higher BMI groups.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000>Further exploring and delving into this issue, I think, could provide such important information for making vitamin D supplementation benefits available to the entire population, and using 25-hydroxyvitamin D could be a great approach to the problem.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>Taub: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>Thank you both for your incredible insights. I want to conclude by getting recommendations from both of you on what you tell your patients today and what vitamin D levels you aim for.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>Holick: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>I certainly think that following the Endocrine Society<a href=https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2011-0385 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline> practice guidelines </a>is a reasonable approach. They recommend for all adults 1500-2000 units a day. They recognize that if you're obese, you need two to three times more. For my patients, I typically have them on 3000-5000 units a day.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000>For children, the recommendation is 600-1000 units a day. I think that that's very appropriate. Teenagers, I think, should be treated like adults and they should be getting 1500-2000 units a day. Finally, I personally take 6000 units a day; my blood level is 72 ng/mL. I like for my patients to be in the preferred range recommended by the Endocrine Society of 40-60 ng/mL, and up to 100 is perfectly safe.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px;text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000><span class=Bodytext2Bold style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:700><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt>Manson: </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>I would say that the recommendations need to vary according to the health status of the person. During this pandemic, I would err on the side of recommending more vitamin D. Currently, I would recommend, even on a population-wide basis, 1000Â­2000 IUs a day.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000><a href=https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2010-2704 style=color:#06c;text-decoration:underline>In general, prior to the pandemic and once we can get over the pandemic, I do think the Institute of Medicine (National Academy</a><span class=Bodytext20 style=font-family:Arial,sans-serif><span style=color:#000><span><span><span style=letter-spacing:0><span style=font-weight:400><span style=font-style:normal><span style=text-decoration:none><span style=font-variant:normal><span style=font-size:9.5pt> of Medicine) guidelines </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>are not that far off for a generally healthy population, at 600-800 IUs a day; but certainly, taking 1000Â­2000 IUs a day should be perfectly safe. I don't think anyone who wants to hedge their bets and get up to 2000 IUs a day or even a little more should be cautioned against that.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000>The Institute of Medicine did say to avoid more than 4000 IUs a day. I don't think there's much evidence that that's a dangerous dose, but it just hasn't been tested really long term to know whether the benefits would outweigh the risks taking 4000, 5000, or 10,000 IUs a day for 5 years, 10 years, or 15 years. We don't know. Those trials haven't been done. That's why I recommend that people stay more with a moderate dose because there hasn't been strong evidence to date that getting above 1000-2000 IUs a day would be any better.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.05pt><span><span style=color:#000>Mike and I are both endocrinologists, so we're going to be seeing patients who have bone health problems and endocrine problems, and there is always clinician latitude in adapting the dose of vitamin D to the patient's needs. Many patients will need much more than what I've just been talking about for a generally healthy population. Giving someone who has bone health problems or who's had a fracture 4000 IUs a day could be very reasonable. Other examples could include someone with fat malabsorption, someone who is post-gastric bypass surgery, or someone who is taking certain medications that interfere with vitamin D metabolism.</span></span></span></span></p><p style=margin-bottom:12px><span style=font-size:12pt><span style=line-height:11.3pt><span><span style=color:#000>There will be many patients in a clinical setting who will need more vitamin D.
