#### The Role of Vitamin D for Modulating the T Helper 1 Immune Response After the Coronavac Vaccination - July 2022

Journal of Interferon & Cytokine ResearchVol. 42, No. 7 Research Reports,

The purpose of this study was to observe the role of vitamin D levels with T helper 1 (Th1)-type cytokines, such as interferon γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) efficacy, in those who had already received 2 injections of inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) vaccines (CoronaVac). We also observed if these cytokines played any significance in the CoronaVac effectiveness for preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) infection. 

One hundred ninety-four volunteers were monitored for 8 months upon receiving 2 inactivated SARS-CoV2 vaccination injections (CoronaVac, Sinovac Life Sciences). The rate of confirmed Covid-19 infections was the primary outcome. 

Six to 7 weeks after the second vaccine injection, and blood samples were obtained to measure the serum vitamin D, IFN-γ, and IL-12 levels. 

Low vitamin D level was defined if vitamin D level <30 ng/mL. 

Subjects with low vitamin D had lower IFN-γ and IL-12 levels (P = 0.04 and P = 0.04, respectively). The receiver operating characteristics curve analysis revealed that the area under curve for IFN-γ was 0.59, whereas IL-12 was 0.59 for predicting the low vitamin D levels. 

During follow-up, a higher incidence of Covid-19 infections was observed in subjects with low IFN-γ levels (P = 0.03). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis revealed that the cumulative hazard of confirmed Covid-19 cases was increased in subjects with low IFN-γ levels (log-rank test, P = 0.03). We concluded that lower vitamin D level was correlated with a lower Th1 immune response, whereas the adequate IFN-γ level was required to obtain better CoronaVac effectiveness.
