<img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/tg-bar.jpg alt=image width=600><p>Purpose: Preliminary data suggested that bone mineral density (BMD) in transgender adults before initiating gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) is lower when compared to cisgender controls. In this study, we analyzed bone metabolism in a sample of transgender adults before GAHT, and its possible correlation with biochemical profile, body composition and lifestyle habits (i.e., tobacco smoke and physical activity).</p><p>Methods: Medical data, smoking habits, phospho-calcic and hormonal blood tests and densitometric parameters were collected in a sample of 125 transgender adults, 78 Assigned Females At Birth (AFAB) and 47 Assigned Males At Birth (AMAB) before GAHT initiation and 146 cisgender controls (57 females and 89 males) matched by sex assigned at birth and age. 55 transgender and 46 cisgender controls also underwent a complete body composition evaluation and assessment of physical activity using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).</p><p>Results: 14.3% of transgender and 6.2% of cisgender sample, respectively, had z-score values &lt; -2 (p = 0.04). We observed only lower vitamin D values in transgender sample regarding biochemical/hormonal profile. AFAB transgender people had more total fat mass, while AMAB transgender individuals had reduced total lean mass as compared to cisgender people (53.94 ± 7.74 vs 58.38 ± 6.91, p &lt; 0.05). AFAB transgender adults were more likely to be active smokers and tend to spend more time indoor. Fat Mass Index (FMI) was correlated with lumbar and femur BMD both in transgender individuals, while no correlations were found between lean mass parameters and BMD in AMAB transgender people.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/before-transgender-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=34700-hits-for-autism-transgender-or-gender-identity-or-gender-dysphoria-google-scholar---april-2025>34,700 Hits for autism (transgender OR &ldquo;gender identity&rdquo; OR &ldquo;Gender Dysphoria&rdquo;) Google Scholar - April 2025</h4><p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=autism+(transgender+OR+%22gender+identity%22+OR+%22Gender+Dysphoria%22)&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,48">Google Scholar</a></p><ul><li><p>Gender Diversity, Gender Dysphoria/Incongruence, and the Intersection with Autism Spectrum Disorders: An Updated Scoping Review - Dec 2024 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-024-06650-6>FREE PDF</a></p></li><li><p>Research methods at the intersection of gender diversity and autism: A scoping review - April 2024 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613241245595>FREE PDF</a></p></li><li><p>A comparison of gender diversity in transgender young people with and without autistic traits from the Trans 20 cohort study - May 2024 <a href=s://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanwpc.2024.101084>FREE PDF</a></p></li><li><p>Proportional Overrepresentation of Gender-Diverse Identities in Two US-Based Autistic Adult Samples from the SPARK Database - May 2024 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1089/aut.2023.0121>https://doi.org/10.1089/aut.2023.0121</a></p><ul><li>" We found that 16.1% of autistic adults in Dataset 1 and 19.8% of autistic adults in Dataset 2 were gender diverse.

Prior to gender-affirming hormone treatment (GAHT), transwomen have lower bone mineral density (BMD) and a higher prevalence of osteopenia than cismen probably related to external factors, such as hypovitaminosis D and less physical activities. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues in transgender youth may cause bone loss; however, the addition of GAHT restores or at least improves BMD in both transboys and transgirls. The maintenance or increase in BMD shown in short-term longitudinal studies emphasizes that GAHT does not have a negative effect on BMD in adult transwomen and transmen. Gonadectomy is not a risk factor if GAHT is taken correctly. The prevalence of fractures in the transgender population seems to be the same as in the general population but more studies are required on this aspect. To evaluate the risk of osteoporosis, it is mandatory to define the most appropriate reference group not only taking into consideration the medical aspects but also in respect of the selected gender identity of each person.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/bone-health-in-transgender-people.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=autism-and-gender-identity-national-autisticsociety---2023>Autism and gender identity: National Autistic Society - 2023</h4><p><strong>Gender dysphoria</strong></p><p>People may experience discomfort or distress when their assigned sex is different from the gender they identify with – this is known as gender dysphoria (GD). There is some evidence to show a link between gender dysphoria and autism, and that autistic people may be more likely than other people to have gender dysphoria. However there is little evidence about the reason(s) why, and some recent research suggests the link between autism and gender dysphoria is not so clear. More research is needed. More research is also required to develop and test assessment tools, support and treatment for autistic people experiencing gender dysphoria.</p><p>" I think there is a huge overlap with autistic people and transgender people.

Bioavailable 25(OH)D consists of albumin-bound and free 25(OH)D and is available for metabolic processes. As sex steroids influence DBP, hormonal treatment (HT) in transgender people might affect DBP and consequently the available 25(OH)D.

We investigated diagnosed GD in patients formally diagnosed with ASD and matched controls in the Military Health System.</p><p>Methods: We performed a retrospective case-cohort study of GD diagnoses in children aged 2–18 years with and without ASD utilizing healthcare records from 2000 to 2013. Cases were formally diagnosed with ASD and matched to five controls by date of birth, gender marker, and enrollment time. Outpatient visits for GD were identified by relevant International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Logistic regression analysis determined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of GD diagnoses by ASD.</p><p>Results: A total of 48,762 children with diagnosed ASD were identified, and each matched to five controls, for a <strong>total of 292,572 children</strong> . Cases and controls were each 80% assigned male at birth. The median end age of included children was 11.6 years. Of included children, 66 (0.02%) had diagnosed GD. <strong>Children with ASD were over four times as likely to be diagnosed with a condition indicating GD (OR 4.38</strong> <span>[95% CI 2.64–7.27]</span>, p &lt; 0.001) compared with matched controls.</p><p>Conclusion: This study corroborates previous research indicating an overrepresentation of GD in children with ASD. Further research is needed to understand the association and to demonstrate approaches to providing optimal care to these children.</p><hr><h4 id=the-intersection-of-autism-and-lgbtq-identitieshttpsriseandshinechildrensnationalorgthe-intersection-of-autism-and-lgbtq-identities--june2021>THE INTERSECTION OF <a href=https://riseandshine.childrensnational.org/the-intersection-of-autism-and-lgbtq-identities/>AUTISM AND LGBTQ+ IDENTITIES</a> – June 2021</h4><p>Approximately 3.5% of adults in the U.S. identify within the LGBTQ+ umbrella (as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, etc.). Studies from the last decade suggest that these rates may be higher for autistic individuals. For example, a recent international study of more than 600,000 adults identified that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was 3 to 6.4 times more common among transgender people compared to cisgender (i.e., non-transgender) people, and studies of autistic adults report that more than 10% may identify as a gender different from their sex assigned at birth. Similarly, evidence indicates sexual orientation diversity (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual sexual orientations) may be more common among autistic individuals. We do not understand why LGBTQ+ identities may be more common among autistic people.</p><hr><h4 id=autism-transgender-etc-aug2020>Autism, Transgender, etc. Aug 2020</h4><p><strong>Elevated rates of autism, other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses, and autistic traits in transgender and gender-diverse individuals</strong></p><p>Nature Communications volume 11, Article number: 3959 (2020)</p><p>Varun Warrier, David M.

To investigate this, we use five independently recruited cross-sectional datasets consisting of 641,860 individuals who completed information on gender, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses including autism, and measures of traits related to autism (self-report measures of autistic traits, empathy, systemizing, and sensory sensitivity). Compared to cisgender individuals, transgender and gender-diverse individuals have, on average, higher rates of autism, other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses. For both autistic and non-autistic individuals, transgender and gender-diverse individuals score, on average, higher on self-report measures of autistic traits, systemizing, and sensory sensitivity, and, on average, lower on self-report measures of empathy.

Sex differences were also observed in this group. Whereas autistic cisgender birth-assigned males showed a stronger implicit gender-group identification than non-autistic cisgender birth-assigned males, autistic cisgender birth-assigned females showed a weaker gender-group identification than non-autistic cisgender birth-assigned females. Furthermore, autistic cisgender people reported significantly more gender dysphoric feelings and recalled significantly less gender-typed behavior from childhood than non-autistic cisgender individuals. No difference was observed between non-autistic and autistic transgender people. We also found that relative to non-autistic cisgender individuals, both non-autistic transgender and autistic transgender people reported significantly more ASD-like traits. However, mentalizing difficulties were observed only in the latter group.

Our meta-analyses revealed that the pooled estimate of the prevalence of ASD diagnoses in GD/GI people was 11% (p &lt; .001) and the overall effect size of the difference in ASD traits between GD/GI and control people was significant (g = 0.67, p &lt; .001).

Few studies, however, have investigated the impact of this overlap on mental health. This study therefore sought to investigate whether the autism/transgender overlap confers an increased risk of depression or anxiety. An online study of 727 individuals revealed a substantial overlap between transgender identity and autism, with increased autistic traits found in trans men compared to trans women.
