Objective: The relation between vitamin-D and autoimmune disorders has long been investigated regarding to important roles of this hormone in immune regulation. 

We evaluated 25-hydroxy-vitamin-D (25OHD) status of subjects with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and healthy controls.

Methods: Group-1 consisted of 180 euthyroid patients (123 females/57 males) with HT who were on stable dose of L-thyroxine (LT). Sex, age and BMI matched 180 euthyroid subjects with newly diagnosed HT were considered as Group-2 and healthy volunteers (n=180) were enrolled as controls (Group-3). All subjects (n=540) underwent thyroid ultrasound and were evaluated for serum 25OHD, anti-thyroid peroxidase(anti-TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) levels.

Results: Group-1 had the lowest 25OHD levels (11.4±5.2 ng/mL) compared to newly diagnosed HT subjects (Group-2) (13.1±5.9 ng/mL, p=0.002) and to control subjects (15.4±6.8 ng/mL, p<0.001). Serum 25OHD levels directly correlated to thyroid volume (r=0.145, p<0.001) and inversely correlated to anti-TPO (r=-0.361,p<0.001) and anti-TG levels (r=-0.335,p<0.001). The 48.3% of group-1, 35% of group-2, and 20.5% of controls had severe vitamin-D deficiency (25OHD <10ng/ml). Female chronic HT patients had the lowest serum 25OHD levels (10.3±4.58ng/mL), while male control subjects had the highest (19.3±5.9ng/mL) (p<0.001).

Conclusions: We showed that serum 25OHD levels of patients with HT were significantly lower than controls and severity of vitamin-D deficiency correlated with duration of HT, thyroid volume and antibody levels. These findings may suggest a potential role of 25OHD in development of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and/or its progression to hypothyroidism.
