Only 2.3% of  19,000 Physicians (US?) took any vitamin D a decade ago

And the median supplementation at the time was a measly 200 IU

Now we can understand why physicians are generally reluctant to prescribe vitamin D, 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;they did not believe in it enough to take it themselves.  

They had been (incorrectly) trained to believe that  

* [>2,000 IU of vitamin D was toxic](/posts/myth-for-50-years-2000-iu-of-vitamin-d-is-toxic-still-taught-as-fact-in-2010)

* supplements provided no benefits

Yes, we agree with the study conclusions - no heart benefits from taking 200 IU of vitamin D

Background

Experimental studies have demonstrated the role of vitamin D in key pathways related to cardiovascular health. While several studies have investigated the impact of vitamin D therapy on outcomes in subjects with prevalent heart failure, limited research exists on the relationship of dietary vitamin D consumption with the risk of heart failure. Thus, we sought to investigate whether dietary vitamin D consumption was associated with a lower risk of incident heart failure in a large prospective cohort of male physicians.

Methods and Results

We prospectively studied 19,635 males from the Physicians’ Health Study. Dietary vitamin D information was obtained from a baseline food frequency questionnaire, and heart failure information was obtained by questionnaire and validated in a subsample. Mean age was 66.4 years. 

 **Median dietary vitamin D consumption was 200.4 IU and only 2.3% of the subjects used vitamin D supplements** . 

After an average follow-up of 9.3 years, there were 858 new cases of heart failure identified. Higher intake of dietary vitamin D was not associated with incident heart failure in a multivariable adjusted model: hazard ratios (95% CI) of incident heart failure were 1.0 (reference), 1.29 (1.04 to 1.60), 1.17 (0.94 to 1.46), 1.22 (0.98 to 1.53), and 1.16 (0.92 to 1.46) from lowest to highest age- and energy-adjusted vitamin D quintile, respectively, after adjusting for age, BMI, race, exercise, alcohol use, smoking, calories, and prevalent atrial fibrillation (p for linear trend = 0.64).

Conclusions

These data are consistent with a lack of an association between dietary vitamin D and incident heart failure in this population of professionally-employed middle-aged males.
