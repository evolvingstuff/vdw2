* 96% of COPD patients had low vitamin D =  **33X** 

* Those with low Vitamin D were  **18X** as likely to have COPD

most of which are  independently associated with low vitamin D

| Pulmonary hypertension  | 24% |
| Dyslipidemia | 35% |
| Thyroid disease  | 21% |

| Obstructive sleep apnea  | 12 % |

 **From [WikiPedia](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease)** 

* COPD affects 329 million people (5%) 

* In 2012, it ranked as the third-leading cause of death, killing over 3 million people

* An acute exacerbation of COPD is defined as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, a change in the color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD

* The primary risk factor for COPD globally is tobacco smoking. Of those who smoke about 20% will get COPD, and of those who are lifelong smokers about half will get COPD.

* In the United States and United Kingdom, of those with COPD, 80-95% are either current smokers or previously smoked

Background Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are common and strongly influence disease severity and relative healthcare costs. Vitamin D deficiency is frequent among COPD patients and its contributory role in disease exacerbations is widely debated. Our aim was to assess the relationship of serum vitamin D levels with COPD severity and AECOPD.

Methods Serum vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) levels were measured in 97 COPD patients and related to lung function, comorbidities, FEV1 decline, AECOPD and hospital admission during the previous year.

Results Most patients (96%) had vitamin D deficiency, which was severe in 35 (36%). No significant relationship was found between vitamin D and FEV1 or annual FEV1 decline. No difference between patients with and without severe vitamin D deficiency was found in age, gender, BMI, smoking history, lung function, and comorbidities, apart from osteoporosis (60.9% in severe deficiency vs 22.7%, p?=?0.001). In multiple logistic regression models, severe deficiency was independently associated with 

* AECOPD <span>[adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of __30.5__(95%CI 5.55, 168), p?<?0.001]</span> and 

* hospitalization <span>[aOR 3.83 (95%CI 1.29, 11.4), p?=?0.02]</span>. 

The odds ratio of being a frequent exacerbator if having severe vitamin D deficiency was  **18.1**  (95%CI 4.98, 65.8) (p?<?0.001), while that of  **hospitalization was 4.57**  (95%CI 1.83, 11.4) (p?=?0.001).

Conclusions In COPD patients severe vitamin D deficiency was related to more frequent disease exacerbations and hospitalization during the year previous to the measurement of vitamin D. This association was independent of patients? characteristics and comorbidities.

> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common respiratory diseases and a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Disturbed innate immune processes characterize the pathogenesis of COPD.  **Vitamin D deficiency is very common in COPD patients and has been associated with disease severity** . Interestingly, a number of mechanistic evidence from animal and in vitro studies has demonstrated important innate immunomodulatory functions of vitamin D, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and antimicrobial functions. In this review, we will discuss in detail how these innate immunomodulatory functions of vitamin D could provide therapeutic potential in COPD patients. Finally, the remaining challenges associated with vitamin D therapy in COPD patients will be discussed.
