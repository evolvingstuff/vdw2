This appears to be the first study of the affects of high-dose vitamin D given to 100,000 Iranian girls. In early 2015

9.4 ng of Vitamin D+ 9 weeks of 50,000 IU/week ==> 36.4 ng

What other studies will be published on this massive intervention?

Hopefully Iran will continue to give the girls 50,000 IU every two weeks as a maintenance dose

Hopefully the Vitamin D measurement was done at least 4 days after the last dose

If so, suspect that the Vitamin D levels will have plateaued at about 50 ng at 20 weeks

Of the 100,000 girls, 988 were studied to see changes in liver function

Did not notice % of girls with poor livers and % with OK livers

| --- | --- |
| Age group | Number(2011)	 |
| 10–14 | 5,671,435 |
| 15–19 | 6,607,043 |

12 million over a 9 year age group in 2011

Probably 6 million girls in 9 year age group

Perhaps 4 million in a 6 year age group

So 100,000 girls = 2.5% of that age group

 **Thus Iran gave 450,000 IU to 2.5% of their teenage girls in 2015**
