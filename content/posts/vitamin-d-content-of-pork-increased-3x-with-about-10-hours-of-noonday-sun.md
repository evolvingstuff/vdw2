#### Sun exposure in pigs increases the vitamin D nutritional quality of pork.

PLoS One. 2017 Nov 14;12(11):e0187877. [doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0187877.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0187877.) eCollection 2017.

<div class="border" style="background-color:#FF9;padding:15px;margin:10px 0;border-radius:5px;width:700px">

* about 10 hours of noonday sun increased Vitamin D levels in lean pork to 40 IU/100 grams

* What if pigs were to get say 300 hours of noonday sun or UV lighting 

   * might the pork have 1000 IU per 100 grams? . 

* Adding indoor ultraviolet lighting is very inexpensive, but currently is not permitted by the FDA.

> Would only need to switch out 10% of standard indoor lighting with UV fluorescent  tubes

> Strangely the FDA permitted reducing Vitamin D by raising pigs, chickens, etc indoors but does not permit increasing the Vitamin D back to what it had been

* A slice of pie had about 2,000 IU – when made with lard from pigs raised outdoors  

> most places 100 years ago, or a few places now

   * Described in 5-minute video [Does Less Sun mean More Disease](/posts/does-less-sun-mean-more-disease)

* Study states that people get <20% of their vitamin D from food. 

> Suspect that food provided about 50% of vitamin D back when 

> animals were raised outdoors, 

> meat had more fat and people ate the fat

> people used lard for baking pies, cakes, cookies, etc.

> people ate organ meats, 

> people ate meat from wild animals, 

> people ate oily fish

There is a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency worldwide likely because of both limited sun-exposure and inadequate dietary intake. Meat, including pork, is not typically considered a dietary source of vitamin D, possibly because of management practices that raise pigs in confinement. This experiment determined the vitamin D content of loin and subcutaneous adipose tissue in sun-exposed finisher pigs. Two separate groups of pigs were used. The first group (28 white Landrace-Duroc) was assigned at random to either sunlight exposure (SUN) in spring and summer or confinement per standard practice (Control). The second (24 Yorkshire-Duroc-Landrace) underwent the same exposure protocol but was exposed in summer and fall or assigned to control (Control). A subsample of five SUN and four Control pigs, matched for weight and body condition score, was selected for slaughter from each group. Pigs (n = 10 SUN, n = 8 Control) had blood drawn for analysis of 25(OH)D3 concentration before/after sun exposure or control, and tissue samples were taken at slaughter for analysis of tissue vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D3 concentration. Three random samples from a single loin chop and surrounding adipose were collected and analyzed. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3 did not differ (P≥0.376) between treatments prior to sun exposure in either group, but was increased (time*treatment interaction, P<0.001) with SUN exposure. Total vitamin D content (D3 plus 25(OH)D3) of loin tissue was increased (P < 0.001) with sun exposure and averaged 0.997±0.094 μg/100g and 0.348±0.027 μg/100g for sun and control pigs, respectively. While exposure to sunlight increased (P = 0.003) tissue content of 25(OH) D in subcutaneous adipose tissue, vitamin D3 content was similar between treatments (P = 0.56). Sunlight exposure in pigs increased the vitamin D content of loin, and may provide an additional source of dietary vitamin D.

#### Note that the pigs got an equivalent of only about 10 sunny hours out of 14 days (1 hour for 14 days)

These pigs were raised in Wyoming ( latitude: 40 degrees)

Can expect far more vitamin D if the same experiment were to be made in Florida ( latitude: 25 degrees)

&nbsp; &nbsp; Note: A few years ago you could buy pasture-raised lard from Florida pigs
