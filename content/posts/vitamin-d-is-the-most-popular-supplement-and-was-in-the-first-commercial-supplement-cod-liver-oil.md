> Comment on cod-liver oil: “Contrary to common belief, cod's liver is not the richest natural source of vitamin D. That of halibut is richer and those of sea bass, swordfish and yellow-fin tuna are intensely more concentrated sources. Striped tuna liver may be a thousand times more concentrated in vitamin D than cod.”
