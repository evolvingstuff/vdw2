* "Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) is a type of brain damage that occurs when an infant’s brain doesn’t receive enough oxygen and blood."

* " the incidence rate in premature babies is 60% of all live births"

* "Perinatal asphyxia, more appropriately known as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), is characterized by clinical and laboratory evidence of acute or subacute brain injury due to asphyxia"

* "Birth asphyxia causes 840,000 or 23% of all neonatal deaths worldwide"

* "Oxygen deprivation, or intrapartum asphyxia, can cause Cerebral Palsy. One of the most common types of brain damage caused by oxygen loss is called hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, or HIE. When HIE occurs, it often leads to severe developmental or cognitive delays, or motor impairments that become more apparent as the child continues to develop"

Emerging evidence has demonstrated that vitamin D plays an important role in many adult neurologic disorders, but is also critical in neuronal development and pruning in the neonatal and pediatric populations. Neonates are at a particularly high risk of vitamin D deficiency, in part due to the high prevalence of maternal deficiency during pregnancy. Several preclinical studies have demonstrated that infants born to vitamin D-deficient mothers are at a high risk of developing neonatal brain injury, and recent clinical studies have shown that neonates with  **hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)**  tend to be vitamin D-deficient. There are limited data, however, on whether additional prenatal or postnatal supplementation may alter the prevalence or severity of neonatal HIE. This review examines the current data supporting the neuroprotective role of vitamin D, with a focus on how these findings may be translated to neonates with HIE.
