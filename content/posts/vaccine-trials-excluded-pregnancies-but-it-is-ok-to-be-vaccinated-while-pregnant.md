high rates of reported miscarriage and premature births, even in CDC system which has 10x fewer reports than the system used in the EU

* "At present, all we can confidently say is that short-term harmful effects of COVID-19 vaccines are being reported at a staggering rate, and that the long-term effects are completely unknown."

#### Pfizer and Moderna vaccines appear safe, effective during pregnancy - April 27, 2021

 **[web](https://www.mdedge.com/obgyn/article/239293/coronavirus-updates/pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines-appear-safe-effective-during?ecd=wnl_evn_210428_mdedge_8pm&uac=138704MX&utm_source=News_MDedge_eNL_042821_D&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Pfizer+developing+pill+to+treat+COVID-19+symptoms&sso=true)** 

* "Researchers found that 86% of pregnancies resulted in a live birth, 12.6 % resulted in spontaneous abortions, and 0.1% resulted in stillbirth. They also found that, among the live births, 9.4% were preterm, 3.2% of babies were small for their gestational age, and 2.2% had congenital anomalies."

#### COVID-19 Vaccination in Pregnant and Lactating Women - JAMA Feb  2021

#### Pregnancy, Postpartum Care, and COVID-19 Vaccination in 2021 - JAMA Feb 2021

 **[web](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776447?guestAccessKey=bcccbf16-afad-41a8-b439-580971294d03&utm_source=silverchair&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=article_alert-jama&utm_content=olf&utm_term=020821)** 

 **Reasoning appears to be** 

1) Known COVID-19 problems if pregnant

2) Seem that influenza vaccine has minimal problems during pregnancy

3) Suspect (based on ZERO data)  that COVID-19 vaccines will have similar minimal problems

 **Also note:** 

1) WHO recommends AGAINST vaccination while pregnant

2) Only 5% of the vaccine participants were >65, yet most COVID-19 deaths are >65

3) Vaccine trials excluded those under age 16, yet they, like pregnany women, might soon be given a COVID-19 vaccine

#### COVID-19 mRNA Shots Are Legally Not Vaccines] Mercola - Feb 9, 2021

 **[web](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/02/09/coronavirus-mrna-vaccine.aspx?ui=d738e3df52a8a14aea9298fe6ec5bc113ed0d6d7922f31861727d54a43cbe29d&sd=20121119&cid_source=dnl&cid_medium=email&cid_content=art1HL&cid=20210209_HL2&mid=DM799847&rid=1079741767)** 

 **STORY AT-A-GLANCE** 

* By referring to COVID-19 vaccines as “vaccines” rather than gene therapies, the U.S. government is violating its 15 U.S. Code Section 41, which regulates deceptive practices in medical claims

* The mRNA injections are gene therapies that do not fulfill a single criteria or definition of a vaccine

* COVID-19 “vaccines” do not impart immunity or inhibit transmissibility of the disease. 

   * They only are designed to lessen your infection symptoms if or when you get infected. 

   * As such, these products do not meet the legal or medical definition of a vaccine

* By calling this experimental gene therapy technology a “vaccine,” they are circumventing liability for damages that would otherwise apply
