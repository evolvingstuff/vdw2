The   recent   discovery   –   in   a   randomised,   controlled   trial   –   that   daily ingestion  of  1100  IU  of  colecalciferol  (vitamin  D)  over  a  4-year  period dramatically  reduced  the  incidence  of  non-skin  cancers  makes  it  difficult to  overstate  the  potential  medical,  social  and  economic  implications  of treating   vitamin   D   deficiency.   Not   only   are   such   deficiencies   common, probably  the  rule,  vitamin  D  deficiency  stands  implicated  in  a  host  of diseases   other   than   cancer.   The   metabolic   product   of   vitamin   D   is   a potent,   pleiotropic,   repair   and   maintenance,   secosteroid   hormone   that targets  >  200  human  genes  in  a  wide  variety  of  tissues,  meaning  it  has  as many  mechanisms  of  action  as  genes  it  targets.  A  common  misconception is   that   government   agencies   designed   present   intake   recommendations to  prevent  or  treat  vitamin  D  deficiency.  They  did  not.  Instead,  they  are guidelines  to  prevent  particular  metabolic  bone  diseases.  Official  recommendations  were  never  designed  and  are  not  effective  in  preventing  or treating  vitamin  D  deficiency  and  in  no  way  limit  the  freedom  of  the physician   –   or   responsibility   –   to   do   so.   At   this   time,   assessing   serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin  D  is  the  only  way  to  make  the  diagnosis  and  to  assure that  treatment  is  adequate  and  safe.  The  authors  believe  that  treatment should be sufficient to maintain levels found in humans living naturally in a sun-rich  environment,  that  is,  >  40  ng/ml,  year  around.  Three  treatment modalities exist: sunlight, artificial ultraviolet B radiation or supplementation. All treatment modalities have their potential risks and benefits. Benefits of all treatment modalities outweigh potential risks and greatly outweigh the risk  of  no  treatment.  As  a  prolonged  ‘vitamin  D  winter’,  centred  on  the winter  solstice,  occurs  at  many  temperate  latitudes,  ? 5000  IU  (125  ?g)  of vitamin D/day may be required in obese, aged and/or dark-skinned patients to  maintain  adequate  levels  during  the  winter,  a  dose  that  makes  many physicians uncomfortable.

## 1.  Introduction

Recently,   Lappe   et   al.   reported   the   first   population-based,   double-blind, randomised,  placebo-controlled,  interventional  trial  of  colecalciferol  (vitamin  D) with  non-skin  cancer  prevention  as  a  principal  secondary  end  point  ?<sup>[1]</sup>.  They found that 1100 IU of vitamin D and 1500 mg of calcium per day administered to 403 Nebraska women over 4 years dramatically reduced the relative risk (0.232) for incident cancers compared with 206 placebo controls (p < 0.005). Furthermore, baseline  and  treatment-induced  serum  25-hydroxy-vitamin  D  (25<span>[OH]</span>D)  levels were strong and independent predictors of cancer risk.

Besides   cancer,   vitamin   D   deficiency   is   associated   with   cardiovascular disease,   hypertension,  stroke,  diabetes,  multiple  sclerosis,  rheumatoid  arthritis, inflammatory  bowel  disease,  periodontal  disease,  macular  degeneration,  mental illness,   propensity   to   fall   and   chronic   pain   ?<span>[2-6]</span>.   The   recent   meta-analysis of  18  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  indicating  that vitamin   D,   even   in   relatively   low   doses,   reduces   total mortality  ?<sup>[7]</sup>   adds  to  the  growing  evidence  that  this  is  a unique vitamin.

The  vitamin  D  field  is  expanding  so  rapidly,  and  the diseases   implicated   so   pervasive,   that   recent   discoveries defy  both  the  imagination  and  credulity.  For  example,  a recent review presented considerable evidence that influenza epidemics,   and   perhaps   other   wintertime   infections,   are brought on by seasonal deficiencies in antimicrobial peptides secondary  to  seasonal  deficiencies  in  vitamin  D  ?<sup>[8]</sup>.  Recent post-hoc  analysis  of  a  RCT  supported  the  theory,  finding 2000 IU of vitamin D/day virtually liminated self-reported incidences of colds and influenza ?<sup>[9]</sup>. Even the present twin childhood epidemics of autism ?<sup>[10]</sup> and type 1 diabetes ?<sup>[11]</sup>, both of which occurred  hortly after sun-avoidance advice became widespread, may be sequela of gestational  or  early  childhood  vitamin  D  deficiency.  It  is beyond  the  scope  of  this  article  to  discuss  all  these  diseases in detail, but the reviews cited above discuss many of them. Furthermore,  such  theories  are  just  that,  theories,  and,  like all   theories,   await   further   science.   While   we   wait   for the  RCTs  needed  to  clarify  the  role  of  vitamin  D  in  the prevention   of   disease,   a   strong   case   already   exists   for diagnosing and treating vitamin D deficiency ?<sup>[12,13]</sup>.

Other  than  its  role  in  treating  various  bone  diseases,  we are only beginning to learn of the role vitamin D may have in  treating  disease.  For  example,  a  study  of  recurrence-free survival  in  early-stage,  non-small-cell  lung  cancer  patients found  those  with  the  highest  vitamin  D  input  had  double the 5-year recurrence-free survival and better overall survival than  those  with  the  lowest  ?<sup>[14]</sup>.  This  strongly  implies  a vitamin  D  treatment  effect,  that  is,  untreated  vitamin  D

deficiency  in  non-small-cell  lung  cancer  patients  is  a  risk factor  for  early  death.  Because  the  anticancer  mechanism of   action   of   vitamin   D   (reducing   cellular   proliferation, inducing  differentiation,  inducing  apoptosis  and  preventing angioneogenesis)  is  basic  to  all  cancers,  it  is  reasonable to  hypothesise  a  general  cancer  treatment  effect,  at  least in  the  early  stages  of  cancer,  when  aberrant  cells  are  more likely  to  retain  the  vitamin  D  receptor  and  the  ability  to activate vitamin D.

Furthermore,   non-fatal,   but   life-impairing,   conditions are  also  associated  with  vitamin  D  deficiency.  For  example, chronic   idiopathic   musculoskeletal   pain,   especially   low back  pain,  is  common  in  vitamin  D  deficient  patients. In   one   study,   93%   of   patients   with   such   pain   had low  25(OH)D  levels  ?<sup>[15]</sup>.  More  recently,  a  cross-sectional population study of South Asian women found that chronic pain  was  three-times  more  common  among  those  with  the lowest 25(OH)D levels ?<sup>[16]</sup>.

Several open studies have reported successful treatment of chronic  pain  with  supplemental  vitamin  D  ?<sup>[17,18]</sup>.  In  the largest  study  so  far,  83%  of  299  patients  with  idiopathic chronic low back pain were severely vitamin D deficient and the   symptoms   in   the   great   majority   of   these   patients dissipated after taking 5000 – 10,000 IU of 25(OH)D daily for   3   months   ?<sup>[19]</sup>.   A   recent   review   pointed   out   the importance   and   effectiveness   of   diagnosing   and   treating vitamin   D   deficiencies   in   the   rehabilitation   setting   ?<sup>[20]</sup>, whereas a second study found high baseline 25(OH)D levels were  associated  with  better  functional  status,  shorter  length of stay and better progress in rehabilitation ?<sup>[21]</sup>.

The authors use cancer and chronic pain as examples for two reasons; the data linking these conditions to vitamin D deficiency are epidemiological and, until Lappe et al. ?<sup>[1]</sup>, the studies   showing   a   treatment   or   preventive   effect   were either epidemiological or open trials. This is true of virtually every  disease  associated  with  vitamin  D  deficiency  other than   metabolic   bone   disease,   fractures   and   the   risk   of falls  ?<sup>[22,23]</sup>.  The  lack  of  RCTs  in  the  majority  of  diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency is an argument not to use  vitamin  D  as  adjuvant  treatment  for  these  conditions until such studies prove its effectiveness. However,   is   that   an   argument   not   to   diagnose   and treat  vitamin  D  deficiency?  If  human  RCTs  exist  showing cigarette  smoking  is  dangerous,  the  authors  have  yet  to locate   them.   Instead,   the   compelling   evidence   for   the dangerousness of smoking exists in convincing epidemiological data  and the  demonstration of  a mechanism  of  action. The same  is  true  for  vitamin  D,  although  the  diseases  linked  to vitamin  D  deficiency  outnumber  those  linked  to  cigarette smoking  –  as  the  above  reviews  indicate  –  and  activated vitamin D, a secosteroid, has as many mechanisms of actions as genes it targets. Some would also argue that the quantity and  quality  of  the  epidemiological  data  for  vitamin  D  is approaching  that  which  existed  for  cigarette  smoking  when governments and medical bodies first acted.

## 2.  Incidence of vitamin D deficiency

Adult   vitamin   D   deficiency   is   endemic   ?<span>[24-26]</span>.   A   high number  of  otherwise  healthy  children  and  adolescents  are also  vitamin  D  deficient  ?<sup>[27,28]</sup>.  Rickets,  a  disease  of  the industrial  revolution,  is  resurgent  in  the  US  ?<sup>[29]</sup>  and  Great Britain ?<sup>[30]</sup>. Quite alarmingly – given mounting animal data that   gestational   vitamin   D   deficiency   causes   irreversible brain  damage  in  offspring  ?<sup>[31,32]</sup>   –  severe  deficiencies  are very  common  in  newborn  infants  and  pregnant  women, especially  African-Americans  ?<sup>[33]</sup>.  A  population-based  study of  2972  American  women  of  childbearing  age  found  42% of   African-American   women   in   the   US   had   25(OH)D levels  <  15  ng/ml  and  12%  had  levels  <  10  ng/ml  ?<sup>[34]</sup>. Note  that  25(OH)D  levels  are  reported  in  the  literature  as either ng/ml or nmol/l (1 ng/ml equals 2.5 nmol/l).

Vitamin D deficiency is very common among in-patients, even at respected institutions. For example, a 1998 study of in-patients  at  Massachusetts  General  Hospital  found  57% had  25(OH)D  levels  <  15  ng/ml  ?<sup>[35]</sup>.  A  more  recent  study of Italian in-patients found that mean levels approached the osteomalacic  range  ?<sup>[36]</sup>.  Even  in  sunny  Israel,  a  fourth  of in-patients have such levels ?<sup>[37]</sup>.

Furthermore,  the  definition  of  vitamin  D  deficiency  is changing  almost  yearly  as  research  shows  the  low  end  of ideal  25(OH)D  ranges  are  much  higher  than  we  thought only a few years ago. Most of the aforementioned prevalence studies  used  outdated  reference  values  for  25(OH)D  and, therefore,  greatly  underestimate  the  incidence  of  vitamin  D deficiency.   Obviously,   the   higher   the   25(OH)D   cut-off point,    the    higher    the    percentage    of    the    population with deficiency.

The  critical  question  is,  ‘What  is  an  ideal  25(OH)D level?’  Levels  needed  to  prevent  rickets  and  osteomalacia (15  ng/ml)  are  lower  than  those  that  dramatically  suppress parathyroid  hormone  levels  (20  –  30  ng/ml)  ?<sup>[38]</sup>.  In  turn, those   levels   are   lower   than   levels   needed   to   optimise intestinal calcium absorption (34 ng/ml) ?<sup>[39]</sup>. Neuromuscular performance   in   4100   older   patients   steadily   improved as  25(OH)D  levels  increased  and  peak  performance  was associated  with  levels  ?  38  ng/ml  ?<sup>[40]</sup>.  Lappe  et  al.  ?<sup>[1]</sup> recently  found  that  increasing  mean  baseline  levels  from

29  to  38  ng/ml  was  associated  with  a  dramatic  reduction in   the   incidence   of   internal   cancers.   Recent   pooled meta-analyses  estimated  levels  of  33  ng/ml  were  associated with  a  50%  lower  risk  of  colon  cancer  ?<sup>[41]</sup>   and  levels  of 52   ng/ml   with   a   50%   reduction   in   the   incidence   of breast cancer ?<sup>[42]</sup>.

Although   some   experts   believe   the   lower   limit   of adequate  25(OH)D  levels  are  in  the  low  30s  ?<sup>[12,43]</sup>,  others recommend   up   to   40   ng/ml   ?<sup>[44]</sup>;   there   is   certainly   no scientific   consensus.   Ideal   levels   are   unknown,   but   are probably  close  to  levels  the  human  genome  evolved  on. Natural  levels,  that  is,  levels  found  in  humans  who  live  or work  in  the  sun,  are  ? 50  –  70  ng/ml  –  levels  attained  by only a small fraction of modern humans ?<sup>[45]</sup>. While we wait for  scientific  consensus,  the  question  is,  do  we  wait  with 25(OH)D levels that reflect a sun-avoidant life style or is it safer to wait with levels normally achieved by humans living naturally in a sun-rich environment?

## 3.  Vitamin D metabolism and physiology

Perhaps  because  the  term  vitamin  D  contains  the  word ‘vitamin’,   most   people   wrongly   assume   it   is   like   other vitamins,  that  is,  they  can  obtain  adequate  amounts  by eating a good diet. However, the natural diets most humans consume contain little vitamin D, unless those diets are rich in  wild-caught,  fatty  fish.  Small  amounts  of  vitamin  D  are contained  in  fortified  foods,  such  as  fortified  milk,  orange juice  and  cereals  in  the  US,  and  margarines  in  Europe,  but such  sources  are  usually  minor  contributors  to  vitamin  D stores. Traditionally, the human vitamin D system began in the skin, not in the mouth.

The  manufacture  of  vitamin  D  by  skin  is  extraordinarily rapid  and  remarkably  robust;  production  after  only  a  few minutes   of   sunlight   easily   exceeds   dietary   sources   by an   order   of   magnitude   ?<sup>[2]</sup>.   Incidental   sun   exposure, not  dietary  intake,  is  the  principal  source  of  circulating vitamin  D  stores  and  to  a  degree  that  is  a  function  of  skin surface  area  exposed  ?<sup>[46,47]</sup>.  For  example,  when  fair-skinned people  sunbathe  in  the  summer  (one,  full-body,  minimal erythemal   dose   of   ultraviolet   B   radiation   <span>[UVB]</span>),   they produce  ?  20,000  IU  of  vitamin  D  in  <  30  min  ?<sup>[48]</sup>. One   would   have   to   drink   200   glasses   of   American milk (100 IU/8-oz glass) or take 50 standard multivitamins (400 IU/tablet) in one sitting to obtain this amount orally.

Vitamin  D  normally  enters  the  circulation  after  UVB from   sunlight   strikes   7-dehydro-cholesterol   in   the   skin converting  it  through  thermal  energy  to  vitamin  D3  or colecalciferol (vitamin D). When taken by mouth, the body metabolises  vitamin  D  similarly  to  that  generated  in  the skin.   No   matter   how   it   arrives   in   the   circulation,   the liver readily hydroxylates vitamin D – using cytochrome P450 enzymes – to 25(OH)D, the circulating form of vitamin D. The   serum   half-life   of   25(OH)D,   as   estimated   from submariners    deprived    of    sunlight,    is    ?   60    days, although   radioisotope   tracer-based   half-life   estimates   are considerably shorter.

The classic endocrine function of vitamin D begins when the kidney further hydroxylates 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH)2D, which then acts to maintain serum calcium through a series of  direct  effects  on  calcium  absorption  and  excretion,  and through a series of inter-relationships with serum phosphate and    parathyroid    hormone.    Serum    1,25(OH)2D    levels are   generally   in   the   normal   range   or   even   high,   when 25(OH)D   levels   are   low,   except   in   extreme   vitamin   D deficiency.   Furthermore,   endocrine   1,25(OH)2D   is   an adaptive   hormone   (i.e.,   it   is   produced   in   response   to calcium  deficiency);  1,25(OH)2D  levels  are  typically  low when calcium intake is high.

In the last 10 years, it has become clear that the vitamin D steroid   hormone   system   includes   more   than   this   classic endocrine pathway used to preserve the calcium economy ?<sup>[49]</sup>. The  cytochrome  P450  enzyme  that  further  hydroxylates 25(OH)D  to  1,25(OH)2D  is  present  in  a  wide  variety of    human    tissues    other    than    kidney.    That    is,    the hormone  directly  affects  numerous  cells  and  tissues  via  its autocrine,  and  presumed  paracrine,  functions  ?<sup>[50]</sup>.  Like  all steroid  hormones  (hormone:  from  the  Greek,  to  urge  on), 1,25(OH)2D  acts  as  a  molecular  switch,  activating  >  200 target  genes.  Most  organs  in  the  body  show  evidence  of end-organ responsiveness to 1,25(OH)2D ?<sup>[51]</sup>.

For  example,  the  role  of  vitamin  D  on  the  expression of   naturally-occurring   human   antibiotics,   antimicrobial peptides  (AMPs),  has  become  evident  only  recently  ?<sup>[52,53]</sup>. AMPs  exhibit  broad-spectrum  antimicrobial  activity  against bacteria,  fungi  and  viruses  ?<sup>[54]</sup>.  Both  epithelial  cells  and macrophages  increase  expression  of  AMP  on  exposure  to microbes,  an  expression  that  is  dependent  on  the  presence of   vitamin   D   ?<sup>[55]</sup>.   Pathogenic   microbes   stimulate   the production  of  a  hydroxylase,  which  converts  25(OH)D  to 1,25(OH)2D. This in turn, activates a suite of genes involved in defence.

In the macrophage, the presence of vitamin D also appears to  suppress  the  pro-inflammatory  cytokines,  IFN-?, TNF-? and  IL-12  ?<sup>[55]</sup>.  Thus,  vitamin  D  appears  to  both  enhance the   capacity   of   the   innate   immune   system   to   produce endogenous  antibiotics  and  –  at  the  same  time  –  dampen certain  arms  of  the  adaptive  immune  response,  especially those    responsible    for    the    signs    and    symptoms    of acute inflammation.

Plasma levels of vitamin 25(OH)D in African-Americans, known  to  be  much  lower  than  white-skinned  individuals, are  inadequate  to  fully  stimulate  the  vitamin  D-dependent antimicrobial circuits within the innate immune system ?<sup>[56]</sup>. However, the addition of 25(OH)D restored the dependent circuits  and  enhanced  expression  of  the  AMP,  cathelicidin.

As   discussed   below,   high   concentrations   of   melanin   in the  skin  slows  the  production  of  vitamin  D  and  ageing greatly reduces skin production. Therefore, easily-correctable deficiencies  in  innate  immunity  probably  exist  in  many people,   particularly   dark-skinned   and   aged   individuals, especially in the winter.

Most importantly, and unlike any other steroid hormone, substrate   concentrations   are   absolutely   rate-limiting   for 1,25(OH)2D production. The enzyme that first hydroxylates vitamin   D   in   the   liver   and   the   enzyme   in   tissue   that subsequently  hydroxylates  25(OH)D  to  form  1,25(OH)2D, both   operate   below   their   respective   Michaelis-Menten constants throughout the full range of their normal substrate concentrations  (i.e.,  the  reactions  follow  first-order  mass action  kinetics)  ?<sup>[57]</sup>.  Tissue  levels  of  1,25(OH)2D  directly depend  on  25(OH)D  blood  levels,  which,  in  turn,  directly depend  on  the  amount  of  vitamin  D  made  in  the  skin  or put in the mouth.

That  is,  the  rate-limiting  step  for  the  production  of  this secosteroid  is  unique;  tissue  concentrations  of  1,25(OH)2D are  directly  dependent  on  25(OH)D  levels  and  25(OH)D levels are entirely dependent on human behaviour. Therefore, the step into the sun, into the shade, to the supplements or to   the   sunscreen,   rate-limits   tissue   1,25(OH)2D   levels. Such  extraordinary  rate  limitations  are  not  only  unique  for a   steroid   hormone,   they   are   key   to   understanding   the remarkable pharmacology of vitamin D.

## 4.  Factors affecting vitamin D levels

Factors   that   affect   cutaneous   production   of   vitamin   D include  latitude,  season,  time  of  day,  air  pollution,  cloud cover,  melanin  content  of  the  skin,  use  of  sunblock,  age and  the  extent  of  clothing  covering  the  body.  When  the sun  is  low  on  the  horizon,  atmospheric  ozone,  clouds  and particulate  air  pollution  deflect  UVB  radiation  away  from the  surface  of  the  Earth.  Therefore,  cutaneous  vitamin  D production  is  effectively  absent  early  and  late  in  the  day and  for  the  entire  day  during  several  wintertime  months at latitudes > 35°.

For  that  reason,  vitamin  D  deficiency  is  more  common the  further  poleward  the  population.  For  example,  Boston, Massachusetts  (latitude  42°)  has  a  4-month  ‘vitamin  D winter’  centred  around  the  winter  solstice  when  no  UVB penetrates the atmosphere and an even longer period in the fall and late winter when UVB only penetrates around solar noon. In northern Europe or Canada, the ‘vitamin D winter’ can  extend  for  6  months.  Furthermore,  properly  applied sunblock,  common  window  glass  in  homes  or  cars,  and clothing,  all  effectively  block  UVB  radiation  –  even  in  the summer. Those who avoid sunlight – at any latitude – are at risk  any  time  of  the  year.  For  example,  a  surprisingly  high incidence  of  vitamin  D  deficiency  exists  in  Miami,  Florida despite its sunny weather and subtropical latitude ?<sup>[58]</sup>.

African-Americans,  the  elderly  and  the  obese  face  added risk.   As   melanin   in   the   skin   acts   as   an   effective   and ever-present  sunscreen,  dark-skinned  patients  need  much longer UVB exposure times to generate the same 25(OH)D stores  compared  with  fair-skinned  patients  ?<sup>[59]</sup>. The  elderly make much less vitamin D than 20-year-olds after exposure to the same amount of sunlight ?<sup>[60]</sup>. Obesity is also major risk factor for vitamin D deficiency with obese African-Americans at an even higher risk ?<sup>[61]</sup>. Therefore, those who work indoors, live at higher latitudes, wear extensive clothing, regularly use sunblock, are dark-skinned, obese, aged or consciously avoid the sun, are at high-risk for vitamin D deficiency.

## 5.  Diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency

Metabolic  bone  disease,  prevention  of  falls  and  fractures, and    treatment    of    secondary    hypothyoidism    are    the classic   reasons   to   treat   with   vitamin   D.     Nevertheless, the treatment   of asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency is the most common reason to prescribe vitamin D. However, like all  diagnoses,  one  must  think  of  it  before  one  can  make  it. Then,  like  any  diagnosis,  the  physician  must  confirm  it  or rule  it  out  by  means  of  history,  physical  examination  and laboratory assessment.

The  classic  presentation  of  severe  vitamin  D  deficiency is  metabolic  bone  disease  in  adults  and  rickets  –  with  or without hypocalcaemic tetany – in children, a subject recently reviewed    by    Holick    ?<sup>[2]</sup>.    Osteomalacia    (unmineralised collagen matrix) presents after the epiphyseal plates fuse and can  occur  in  adolescence.  Stress  fractures  –  in  otherwise healthy  adolescents  and  adults  –  may  indicate  vitamin  D deficiency  ?<sup>[62]</sup>.  Unexplained  fractures  in  childhood  may  be rickets  and  not  child  physical  abuse  ?<span>[63-65]</span>.  Radiographs  of the wrist, alkaline phosphatase, and 25(OH)D level must be obtained before making life-altering – and false – accusations.

Vitamin   D   deficiency   often   presents   with   common, non-specific    symptoms,    such    as    muscular    weakness    – predominantly  of  the  proximal  limb  muscles  –  a  feeling of   heaviness   in   the   legs,   chronic   musculoskeletal   pain, fatigue or easy tiring ?<sup>[66]</sup>. The pain may have a hyperaesthetic quality.  Osteomalacia  may  masquerade  as  fibromyalgia  ?<sup>[67]</sup>. Physical examination is usually unremarkable, but may reveal undue  pain  on  sternal  or  tibial  pressure.  However,  the  vast majority of cases are asymptomatic.

The    aged    may    be    wheelchair-bound    secondary    to vitamin  D-deficiency-induced  myopathy,  yet  they  typically recover their mobility after treatment ?<sup>[68]</sup>. The recent strong association  of  low  mood  and  cognitive  impairment  in  the aged  with  vitamin  D  deficiency  ?<sup>[69]</sup>  suggests  that  such  pre- sentations may occur in the aged. A blinded, interventional trial   found   4000   IU   of   vitamin   D/day   improved   the mood  of  endocrinology  out-patients  ?<sup>[70]</sup>,  but  there  are  no interventional studies of its effects on cognition.

Even  without  physical  signs  or  symptoms,  the  physician should  screen  those  at  risk.  Obtaining  and  properly  inter- preting a serum 25(OH)D level is the only way to make the diagnosis and should be assessed at least twice yearly in any patient  at  risk,  once  in  the  early  spring  for  the  nadir  and once in the late summer for a peak level ?<sup>[71]</sup>.

It   warrants   repeating,   that   serum   1,25(OH)2D   levels play no role in diagnosing the condition. The kidney tightly controls  serum  1,25(OH)2D  levels,  which  are  often  normal or even elevated in vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, a patient with  normal  or  high  1,25(OH)2D  serum  levels,  but  low 25(OH)D  levels,  is  vitamin  D  deficient  despite  high  serum levels of the active hormone.

How   can   it   be   that   a   patient   with   normal   or   even high  circulating  levels  of  the  active  form  of  vitamin  D  is somehow  vitamin  D  deficient?  The  most  straightforward answer  is  that  the  endocrine  and  autocrine  functions  of vitamin  D  are  quite  different.  However,  that  is  too  simple an explanation as serum 1,25(OH)2D is plainly delivered to the cells via the systemic circulation. A few points may help resolve the apparent paradox.

First, patients with osteomalacia absorb calcium very poorly, despite  their  usually  normal  serum  level  of  1,25(OH)2D. For  unclear  reasons,  25(OH)D  must  also  be  present  in  the serum  if  the  intestinal  mucosal  response  to  1,25(OH)2D is  to  occur.  Second,  in  many  of  the  animal  models  or  cell culture systems the concentration of 1,25(OH)2D needed to produce  a  particular  effect  is  higher  than  can  be  achieved at   physiological   serum   concentrations   of   1,25(OH)2D. Apparently, the required higher concentration of 1,25(OH)2D must  be  produced  intracellularly,  in  an  autocrine  manner, using circulating 25(OH)D as the substrate.

For  example,  this  appears  to  be  the  case  with  human myelodysplasia and with psoriasis, both of which respond to high systemic doses of 1,25(OH)2D (but at a potential cost of  hypercalcaemia).  In  some  of  the  tumour  model  systems, and  possibly  in  human  myelodysplasia  and  psoriasis,  the afflicted  cells  appear  to  have  lost  the  ability  to  synthesize their own 1,25(OH)2D, a  mutation that  may be important in  the  pathogenesis  of  the  disorder.  Whatever  the  ultimate explanation,  there  is  consensus  that  serum  1,25(OH)2D  is only a measure of the endocrine function of vitamin D and not  an  indicator  of  body  stores  or  the  ability  of  vitamin  D to perform its pleiotropic autocrine functions.

## 6.  Treatment of vitamin D deficiency

Three   options   exist   for   the   treatment   of   vitamin   D deficiency:  sunlight,  artificial  UVB  light  or  supplements; all  have  drawbacks.  A  total  of  15  min  of  summer  noonday sun   or   artificial   UVB   radiation   (such   as   tanning   beds) on  both  sides  of  the  bare  body  will  input  ? 10,000  IU  of vitamin D into the systemic circulation of most light-skinned adults.  One  or  two  such  exposures  a  week  should  maintain 25(OH)D  levels  in  healthy  ranges. Those  who  chose  UVB light for vitamin D repletion, from either sunlight or artificial sources,  should  avoid  sunburns,  which  are  associated  with malignant melanoma. Furthermore, they should understand that  regular  ultraviolet  (UV)  exposure  ages  the  skin  and increases the risk of non-melanoma skin cancers.

The treatment of choice for human vitamin D deficiency is human vitamin D, colecalciferol, also known as vitamin D3. Oral  vitamin  D  treatment  is  more  difficult  than  treatment with UVB light for several reasons. First, unexpectedly high doses  of  vitamin  D  may  be  needed  to  achieve  adequate serum  25(OH)D  levels  (1000  IU  of  vitamin  D  sounds  like a lot; in fact, it is only 25 ?g; that is, 1 ?g is 40 IU). Second, the  amount  of  vitamin  D  needed  varies  with  body  weight, body fat, age, skin colour, season, latitude and sunning habits. Third,  unlike  sun  exposure,  toxicity  is  possible  with  oral supplementation – although it is extraordinarily rare.

Colecalciferol  is  available  over  the  counter  in  the  US (but  not  in  England)  and  via  the  internet  in  400-,  1000-, 2000-   and   (recently)   5000-,   10,000-   and   50,000-IU capsules.  Colecalciferol  1000  IU/day  will  usually  result  in about a 10-ng/ml elevation of serum 25(OH)D when given over 3 – 4 months. Therefore, a patient with an initial level of 10 ng/ml would generally require 3000 IU/day for several months  to  achieve  a  level  of  40  ng/ml  and  4000  IU/day to achieve a level of 50 ng/ml – in the absence of cutaneous UVB   exposure.   However,   its   kinetics   are   not   linear, 1000   IU/day   will   substantially   raise   low   baseline   levels, but a similar dose will not increase higher baseline levels by a  similar  increment.  Treatment  of  vitamin  D  deficiency with  1,25(OH2)D  (calcitriol)  or  analogues  of  1,25(OH2)D

(paricalcitol,  doxercalciferol)  are  inappropriate,  ineffective, dangerous and contraindicated.

The  only  prescription  vitamin  D  preparation  available  in the US and England is the vitamin D analogue, ergocalciferol (vitamin  D2),  available  as  50,000-IU  (1.25-mg)  capsules. Physicians can easily replete most vitamin D deficient patients by  giving  one  or  two  50,000-IU  doses  of  ergocalciferol weekly for 8 – 16 weeks and then maintain 25(OH)D levels >  40  ng/ml  with  50,000-IU  doses  every  1,  2  or  4  weeks. The frequency of dosing depends on pre-existing 25(OH)D levels, age, skin colour, obesity, season, body weight and sun avoidance. However, ergocalciferol is not human vitamin D, it  may  be  a  weaker  agonist,  it  is  not  normally  present in   humans   and   its   consumption   results   in   metabolic by-products  not  normally  found  in  humans  ?<sup>[72]</sup>.  It  is  also two- to four-times less effective than colecalciferol in raising 25(OH)D levels ?<sup>[73,74]</sup>.

Recently, 50,000-IU capsules of colecalciferol (vitamin D3) became   available   at   some   health-food   stores   in   the   US and   over   the   internet.   Grey   et   al.   recently   treated   21 vitamin D-deficient patients with 50,000 IU of colecalciferol weekly for 4 weeks, then 50,000 IU monthly for 1 year ?<sup>[75]</sup>. Blood  levels  rose  from  a  mean  of  11  ng/ml  at  baseline  to 30 ng/ml at 6 months and to 31 ng/ml at 1 year, indicating such  doses  do  not  achieve  natural  25(OH)D  levels  and that 25(OH)D levels do not continue to rise after 6 months of such treatment.

Cod  liver  oil  contains  a  variable  amount  of  vitamin  D, but    usually    contains    high    amounts    of    vitamin    A. Consumption   of   preformed   retinols,   even   in   amounts consumed  by  many  Americans,  may  be  causing  low-grade, but  widespread,  bone  toxicity  ?<sup>[76]</sup>.  Vitamin  A  antagonises the action of vitamin D ?<sup>[77]</sup>  and high retinol intake thwarts the   protective   effect   of   vitamin   D   on   distal   colorectal adenoma  ?<sup>[78]</sup>.  Different  brands  of  cod  liver  oil  contain variable amounts of vitamin D, but usually high amounts of vitamin A; the authors do not recommend cod liver oil.

It  is  important  to  understand  that  neither  the  regular consumption   of   recommended   amounts   of   vitamin   D (e.g.,  400  IU  of  vitamin  D  in  a  multivitamin)  nor  the regular    consumption    of    vitamin    D    fortified    foods (e.g., 100 IU/8-oz glass of milk) effectively prevents vitamin D deficiency   ?<sup>[79,80]</sup>.   Furthermore,   2000   IU/day   for   1   year failed to achieve a 32 ng/ml target 25(OH)D concentration in   40%   of   104   African-American   women   studied   ?<sup>[81]</sup>. Even the administration of 4000 IU/day for > 6 months to middle-age Canadian endocrinology out-patients, resulted in average 25(OH)D levels of 44 ng/ml and produced no side effects other than an improved mood ?<sup>[70]</sup>. Heaney estimated that  ?  3000  IU/day  of  vitamin  D  is  required  to  assure that 97% of Americans obtain levels > 35 ng/ml ?<sup>[43]</sup>. Healthy adult men use between 3000 and 5000 IU of vitamin D/day, if it is available ?<sup>[82]</sup>.

In   general,   the   more   the   patient   weighs,   the   more vitamin  D  will  be  required  and  large  amounts  of  body fat  further  increases  requirements.  Not  only  are  baseline 25(OH)D  levels  lower  in  the  obese,  they  require  higher doses  of  either  oral  supplements  or  UV  irradiation  than lean  individuals  in  order  to  obtain  the  same  increases  in 25(OH)D  blood  levels  ?<sup>[83]</sup>.  Fat  malabsorption  syndromes may  increase  requirements  or  necessitate  the  use  of  UV radiation.  Advancing  age  impairs  the  ability  of  the  skin  to make  vitamin  D,  so  older  people  often  need  higher  doses than  younger  people.  Therefore,  dark-skinned,  large,  obese and  older  patients  often  require  higher  maintenance  doses than  fair-skinned,  small,  thin  or  younger  patients.  Loading doses  of  colecalciferol  10,000  IU/day  for  several  weeks  are safe to use before beginning maintenance therapy.

Physicians who do not want their patients exposed to UV radiation  and  who  do  not  monitor  25(OH)D  levels  should recommend daily supplementation with colecalciferol 2000 IU for   their   adult   and   adolescent   patients,   and   properly document  their  recommendations.  However,  they  should know   that   such   doses   will   not   always   achieve   natural levels  –  especially  in  the  winter  –  in  the  most  vulnerable segments  of  the  population.  The  authors  recommend  that bottle-fed infants be supplemented with 400 IU of vitamin D daily and breast-fed infants with 800 IU daily. Older infants and toddlers may be at extremely high risk during weaning, after they stop fortified infant formula and begin consuming unfortified juices. Toddlers and older children, who do not go into  the  sun,  should  take  1000  –  2000  IU/day,  depending on body weight.

Vitamin   D   deficiency   in   pregnancy   is   an   on-going epidemic  ?<sup>[84]</sup>  and  animal  evidence  continues  to  accumulate that maternal vitamin D deficiency permanently injures foetal brains  ?<sup>[31,32,85]</sup>.  Pregnant  women  –  or  women  thinking  of becoming pregnant – should have 25(OH)D levels checked every 3 months, be adequately treated as outlined above and the advice should be documented in their medical records ?<sup>[86]</sup>. For  those  who  wonder  how  vitamin  D  could  be  important for  brain  development,  given  its  historically  low  levels  in most  breast  milk,  Hollis  and Wagner  discovered  that  breast milk  is  always  a  rich  source  of  vitamin  D  –  enough  to maintain  natural  levels  in  infants  –  as  long  as  lactating mothers take 6,000 IU of vitamin D daily ?<sup>[87]</sup>.

Cytochrome   P450   enzymes   are   responsible   for   both the   initial   metabolism   and   subsequent   catabolism   of vitamin D. Therefore, drugs dependent on cytochrome P450 enzymes  –  and  there  are  many  –  may  effect  vitamin  D metabolism. What clinically relevant interactions cytochrome P450   metabolised   substances   –   including   cardiac   drugs, erythromycins, psychotropics and even grapefruit juice – have on   the   metabolism   of   vitamin   D   is   an   area   awaiting further   research.   Patients   on   such   drugs   should   have frequent  25(OH)D  level  checks  when  being  treated  for vitamin D deficiency.

Of  the  research  done  on  drug/vitamin  D  interactions, anticonvulsants ?<sup>[88]</sup>, corticosteroids, cimetidine, antitubercu- losis  agents,  theophylline  and  orlistat  may  lower  25(OH)D levels, whereas thiazide diuretics increase 25(OH)D levels ?<sup>[89]</sup>. Furthermore,   a   number   of   studies   found   estrogen   and progesterone    raised    1,25(OH)2D    levels,    whereas    the literature  suggests  testosterone  is  unlikely  to  be  a  major factor in vitamin D metabolism ?<sup>[89]</sup>. This raises the possibility that  some  of  the  increased  longevity  of  women  compared with men is due to sex-discrepant metabolism of vitamin D. The  recent  discovery  that  atorvastatin  significantly  increases 25(OH)D   levels   suggests   that   some   –   or   all   –   of   the anti-inflammatory effects of statins may be mediated through increases in vitamin D levels ?<sup>[90]</sup>.

## 7.  Vitamin D toxicity

Vitamin  D  toxicity  (usually  asymptomatic  hypercalcaemia) is  exceedingly  rare  and  few  practicing  physicians  have  ever seen a case ?<sup>[91]</sup>, although that could change with the recent over-the-counter     availability     of     50,000-IU     capsules. True   toxicity   is   secondary   to   the   unbridled   effects   of hypercalcaemia.   First   urine   calcium,   and   then   serum calcium,  will  begin  to  gradually  increase  when  25(OH)D levels   exceed   some   level   >   150   ng/ml   and   such   levels must  be  associated  with  hypercalcaemia  in  order  to  indict vitamin  D  ?<sup>[2,48]</sup>.  True  toxicity  results  when  hypercalcaemia goes  undetected  and  calcifies  internal  organs,  especially  the kidneys.  In  order  to  produce  hypercalcaemia,  most  adults would  have  to  take  well  in  excess  of  10,000  IU/day  for many  months  or  even  years.  Most  patients  with  vitamin  D toxicity recover fully by simply stopping the vitamin D and practicing strict sun-avoidance.

Despite   robust   skin   production,   vitamin   D   toxicity cannot   occur   from   skin   production.   Once   maximum cutaneous  production  occurs,  additional  sun  exposure  will not  result  in  additional  net  input  to  the  system. The  same UVB  that  produces  vitamin  D  in  the  skin  also  degrades  it, causing   a   steady-state   that   generally   limits   cutaneous production  to  a  maximum  of  ?  20,000  IU/day.  For  this reason,  in  spite  of  such  robust  cutaneous  production,  no one  has  ever  reported  vitamin  D  toxicity  from  either  sun exposure or from exposure to artificial UVB light.

Credible   evidence   of   vitamin   D   toxicity   in   adults chronically   consuming   ?   10,000   IU   of   supplemental colecalciferol  a  day  is  absent  in  the  literature.  In  fact,  other than   pharmaceutical   manufacturing   errors,   the   literature contains few cases of colecalciferol toxicity from supplement use;   virtually   all   the   reported   cases   of   hypercalcaemia are   from   faulty   industrial   production,   labeling   errors, dosing  errors  and  in  patients  treated  medically  with  high doses of ergocalciferol.

The   present   upper   limit   for   medically   unsupervised intake  by  adults  and  children  over  the  age  of  1,  set  by  the Institute  of  Medicine’s  Food  and  Nutrition  Board  in  1997, is  2000  IU/day,  a  limit  that  is  based  on  old  –  and  many feel  –  faulty,  literature  ?<sup>[92]</sup>.  Although  a  2000  IU  upper limit may be appropriate for young children, such limits in older children, adolescents and adults have the effect of both limiting  effective  treatment  of  vitamin  D  deficiency  and impairing dose-appropriate interventional research. However, the  present  2000  IU/day  upper  limit  no  more  impairs  the ability  of  physicians  to  treat  vitamin  D  deficiency  with higher  doses  than  comparable  upper  limits  for  calcium  or magnesium   impair   the   ability   of   physicians   to   treat those  deficiencies  with  doses  above  the  upper  limit,  once properly diagnosed.

That  said,  physicians  who  use  higher  doses  may  feel more  comfortable  periodically  monitoring  25(OH)D  levels. Periodic  25(OH)D  levels  will  also  educate  the  physician, not   only   to   the   safety   of   supplementation,   but   to   the surprisingly  high  oral  dose  required  to  achieve  and  then maintain  adequate  serum  25(OH)D  levels,  especially  in  the fall and winter.

## 8.  Absolute and relative contraindications  to treatment

The    only    absolute    contraindication    to    vitamin    D supplementation is vitamin D toxicity or allergy to vitamin D, although  –  to  the  best  of  the  authors’  knowledge  –  there are  no  reports  in  the  literature  of  acute  allergic  reactions  to vitamin  D  supplements.  Contraindications  to  sunlight  or artificial  UV  radiation  include  a  number  of  dermatological conditions  (porphyrias,  xeroderma  pigmentosum,  albinism), as  well  as  various  photosensitisers  (sulfonamides,  pheno- thiazines,   tetracyclines,   psoralens).   Previous   skin   cancers, especially   cutaneous   melanoma,   are   contraindications   to excessive   UV   exposure,   although   a   recent   study   found reduced mortality in melanoma patients who had continued exposure   to   sunlight   ?<sup>[93]</sup>.   However,   for   a   number   of reasons   –   including   medical-legal   reasons   –   the   authors recommend  oral  treatment  for  patients  who  have  had  any type of skin cancer.

Although  the  liver  initially  metabolises  vitamin  D,  liver disease  is  not  a  contraindication  to  treatment  of  deficiency. The  liver  conserves  the  ability  to  hydroxylate  vitamin  D despite advanced liver disease ?<sup>[94]</sup>. In fact, a recent study of patients    with    advanced    non-cholestatic    chronic    liver disease  recommended  treatment  of  concomitant  vitamin  D deficiency   after   finding   that   serum   25(OH)D   levels   of <  10  ng/ml  predicted  coagulopathy,  hyperbilirubinaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, anaemia and thrombocytopaenia ?<sup>[95]</sup>.

Vitamin  D  hypersensitivity  syndromes  –  often  confused with  vitamin  D  toxicity  –  occur  when  extrarenal  tissues produce  1,25(OH)2D  in  an  unregulated  manner  causing hypercalcaemia ?<sup>[96]</sup>. They are diagnosed by measuring serum calcium    (elevated),    25(OH)D    (normal    or    low)    and 1,25(OH)2D  (elevated)  levels.  Vitamin  D  hypersensitivity syndromes can occur in some of the granulomatous diseases (especially sarcoidosis and tuberculosis) and cancer (especially lymphoma).  Such  syndromes  are  a  relative  contraindication to  treatment.  Indeed,  in  the  past,  routine  treatment  of such   syndromes   consisted   of   iatrogenic   production   of deficiency  by  restriction  of  oral  vitamin  D  and  avoidance of sunlight.

Recently, some have questioned the wisdom of withholding vitamin    D    in    vitamin    D    deficient    hypercalcaemic patients.  For  example,  not  only  is  vitamin  D  deficiency  a contributing  factor  to  metabolic  bone  disease  in  primary hyperparathyroidism   (PHPT),   some   patients   diagnosed with  PHPT  may  actually  have  the  disease  secondary  to vitamin D deficiency ?<sup>[97]</sup>. Furthermore, recent data indicate that  high-dose  vitamin  D  repletion  in  21  hypercalcaemic PHPT     patients     did     not     exacerbate     hypercalcaemia and   reduced   abnormalities   in   calcium,   phosphate   and parathyroid hormone. ?<sup>[75]</sup>.

Similar  questions  arise  about  withholding  vitamin  D  in hypercalcaemic  tuberculosis  patients,  as  many  tuberculosis patients – especially dark-skinned patients – are likely to be severely  vitamin  D  deficient  ?<sup>[98]</sup>.  A  recent  controlled  study indicated   adjuvant   vitamin   D   10,000   IU/day   improved sputum    conversion    rates    compared    with    conventional treatment   alone   ?<sup>[99]</sup>.   An   earlier   study   showed   adjuvant vitamin  D  helped  treatment  and  –  surprisingly  –  children with  tuberculosis  given  adjuvant  vitamin  D  were  less  likely to  be  hypercalcaemic  than  children  given  only  standard treatment    ?<sup>[100]</sup>.    An    antimicrobial    treatment    effect    is consistent with recent research, mentioned above, indicating vitamin   D   upregulates   naturally-occurring   –   and   broad spectrum – antimicrobial peptides.

Therefore,  hypercalcaemia  is  a  relative  contraindication to  vitamin  D,  sunlight  or  artificial  UVB  radiation.  The physician   should   carefully   evaluate   any   hypercalcaemic patient  for  the  cause  of  their  hypercalcaemia.  Once  the cause of the hypercalcaemia is clear, if the physician decides to  treat  concomitant  vitamin  D  deficiency  –  despite  the hypercalcaemia – they should only do so if the hypercalcaemia is   mild-to-moderate   (<   12   mg/100   ml)   and   proceed cautiously,  frequently  monitoring  urine  and  serum  calcium, 25(OH)D, and 1,25(OH)2D levels.

## 9.  Summary

Vitamin   D   deficiency   is   endemic   and   associated   with numerous serious diseases. Understanding the physiology of vitamin D and having a high index of suspicion are keys to suspecting the diagnosis. Serum 25(OH)D levels < 40 ng/ml are  seldom  found  in  humans  living  naturally  in  a  sun-rich environment.  Treatment   with   sunlight   or   artificial   UVB radiation  is  simple,  but  increases  the  risk  of  non-melanoma skin cancers and ages the skin. Sunburns increase the risk of malignant  melanoma.  Adequate  oral  supplementation  will require doses that make many physicians uncomfortable.

## 10.  Expert opinion

Perhaps  a  new  era  is  on  medicine,  the  vitamin  D  era; although  –  given  past  false  claims  for  medical  benefits  of vitamins – others may suspect instead a vitamin D error. That said it is difficult to think of a common disease that has not been associated with vitamin D deficiency in a high-quality epidemiological study. The difference between vitamin D and other vitamins is that this remarkable prehormone is the only known  substrate  for  a  ‘repair  and  maintenance’  secosteroid hormone,  whose  mechanisms  of  action  are  limited  only by  the  number  of  genes  it  regulates  and  whose  local  tissue concentrations are rate-limited by human behaviour.

Although   the   existence,   depth   and   breadth   of   any vitamin  D  era  remains  to  be  seen,  a  burgeoning  literature points   to   horizons   beyond   our   vision   and   questions that sound sophomoric to ask. For example, are the diseases of  civilisation  mainly  the  diseases  of  vitamin  D  deficiency? Are    influenza    and    other    viral    respiratory    diseases symptoms  of  vitamin  D  deficiency,  in  the  same  manner that   Pneumocystis   carinii   pneumonia   is   a   symptom   of AIDS  ?<sup>[8]</sup>?  Do  African-Americans  die  prematurely  simply because they have 25(OH)D levels about half that of white patients  <sup>[101]</sup>?  The  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  others have repeatedly found that neurodevelopment disorders such as  mild  mental  retardation  are  more  common  in  African- Americans than white patients <sup>[102,103]</sup>  even after control for socioeconomic  factors  <sup>[104]</sup>.  Is  this  simply  because  African- American  fetuses  are  more  likely  to  develop  in  vitamin  D deficient  wombs?  Is  the  present  dramatic  increase  in  the prevalence of autism over the last 20 years simply the result of medical advice to avoid the sun over that same 20 years ?<sup>[10]</sup>?

If only a fraction of the answers to these questions is yes, what  will  be  the  result  for  medicine,  society,  government and  the  medical  industry?  For  example,  instead  of  a  60% reduction  in  incident  cancers  that  Lappe  et  al.  ?<sup>[1]</sup>   found, say  vitamin  D  only  provides  a  30%  reduction? What  effect would   such   a   reduction   have   on   government   health programs,   pensions,   oncologists,   clinics,   hospitals   and anticancer   drug   manufacturers?   Furthermore,   given   the relatively small dose of vitamin D Lappe et al. ?<sup>[1]</sup>  used, is it reasonable to hypothesise that higher daily doses would have prevented > 60% of incident cancers?

Before we herald a vitamin D era, epidemiological evidence must  give  way  to  larger  RCTs,  both  in  prevention  and treatment.   Such   studies   should   use   human   vitamin   D (colecalciferol),  given  daily,  in  doses  adequate  to  ensure  a treatment effect is not missed (2000 – 10,000 IU/day), with periodic  monitoring  of  25(OH)D  levels  both  to  ensure treatment compliance and to confirm that natural 25(OH)D levels (50 – 70 ng/ml) are obtained by the interventional arm.

However, given what we know today, present government recommendations for ‘adequate intake’ are clearly inadequate and need upward revision. Just as important, present ‘upper limits’  do  not  reflect  the  modern  toxicology  literature.  In fact, many adult patients – if not most – will need to exceed the upper limit simply to maintain natural serum levels.

Likewise, present food fortification strategies are inadequate and  leave  the  most  vulnerable  members  of  our  society  with levels  that  endanger  their  health.  Both  the  amount  used and  the  number  of  foods  fortified  need  upward  revision. Mandatory  fortification  of  juices,  not  just  infant  formula, would  help  fortify  toddlers  during  and  after  weaning,  and mandatory fortification of cereal grain products and cheeses would ensure a supply to African-Americans, many of whom do not drink milk.

To the authors’ knowledge, plaintiffs’ attorneys are not yet involved   in   the   vitamin   D   debate.   After   the   findings of  Lappe  et  al.  ?<sup>[1]</sup>,  it  may  only  be  a  matter  of  time  until lawsuits  against  physicians  begin  to  appear,  claiming  that physicians  dispensed  sun-avoidance  advice,  but  negligently failed   to   diagnose   and   treat   the   consequent   vitamin   D deficiency,   leading   to   fatal   cancers.   Unless   the   future literature fails to support the present, such medical malpractice suits may become commonplace.

Finally,  physicians  and  policy-makers  should  understand that much of the future of vitamin D is out of their hands. Inexpensive   high-dose   vitamin   D   supplements   are   now widely  available  to  the  American  public  over-the-counter and  to  the  world  via  the  internet.  Sunlight  remains  free. A Google search for ‘vitamin D’ reveals several million hits. After  the  Canadian  Cancer  Society  recently  recommended 1000  IU/day  for  all  Canadian  adults  in  the  wintertime, vitamin  D  disappeared  off  the  shelves,  causing  a  shortage during the summer.

The    pleiotropic    actions    and    unique    pharmacology of   vitamin   D   mean   educated   patients,   on   their   own, can    entirely    control    their    own    tissue    levels    of    this steroid,  through  either  UVB  exposure  or  over-the-counter supplementation.    Given    the    attitudes    that    some    in mainstream   medicine   have   about   any   substance   with the   word   ‘vitamin’   in   it   ?<sup>[105]</sup>,   the   public   and   not the   medical   profession   may   be   the   first   to   enter   the vitamin D era.
