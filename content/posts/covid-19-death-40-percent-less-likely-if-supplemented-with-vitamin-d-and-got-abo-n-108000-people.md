#### Comment by Robin W - July 18

This is an observational study with no real control group.  The artificially selected controls include people who are supplementing D3 without a prescription.  Only those supplementing vitamin D (D3 I guess, but maybe D2) due to a prescription are in the D3 supplementation group.  

Likewise the calcifediol supplementation group - and they are only included if they had a creatinine test, which makes me think that most or all of them are being treated for chronic kidney disease.  

The calcifediol supplementation group has an average age of 70 and 85% of them are women.   

The artificially constructed control group matches those individuals other characteristics as much as possible - the only difference being that they are not being prescribed calcifediol.  But some of them will be supplementing D3 or perhaps D2 without prescription - possibly at decent levels rather than the lower intakes many doctors are likely to prescribe.  Also, I guess this artificial control group probably contains lots of people with chronic kidney disease.

There may well be some useful observations about 25OHD levels and disease severity, but we already have such observations.
