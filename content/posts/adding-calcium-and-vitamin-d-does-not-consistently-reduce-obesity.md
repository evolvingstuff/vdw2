#### Calcium and vitamin D in obesity.

Nutr Res Rev. 2012 May 16:1-12. 

Song Q, Sergeev IN.

New and more effective nutritional measures are urgently needed for the prevention of obesity. 

The role of Ca and vitamin D in obesity has been recently implicated. 

Low Ca intake and low vitamin D status have been linked with an increased risk of obesity in epidemiological studies;

 **however, clinical intervention trials designed to test this association have produced controversial results** . 

The suggested anti-obesity mechanisms of Ca and vitamin D include the regulation of adipocyte death (apoptosis), adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. 

Dietary Ca has been also shown to increase faecal fat excretion. 

The potential role of Ca and vitamin D in shifting energy balance towards a more negative state is an area of considerable interest. 

Ultimately, a review of recent research findings does not allow the reaching of a definitive conclusion that increasing Ca intake and rising vitamin D status will influence fat mass and body weight or decrease the risk of obesity and overweight.

Previous studies have shown that about 30% of women lose weight with enough Vitamin D is given with Calcium.

Wonder if this study had a similar result.
