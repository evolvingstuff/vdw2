Few studies have explored these exposures in relation to multiple myeloma (MM) risk. To further evaluate these associations with NHL and MM risk and identify etiologically relevant exposure timing, we pooled data on 566,693 individuals from 6 United States (U.S.) prospective cohort studies (11,636 incident NHL; 2,749 incident MM; median follow-up: 20 years) and used geographic information systems models to estimate residential ambient UVR levels at time points from birth to adulthood. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of residential ambient UVR levels with NHL overall, NHL subtypes, and MM, adjusted for study, age and other putative risk factors. No UVR measures were significantly associated with NHL or NHL subtypes.</p><p>Higher residential UVR levels during cohort follow-up were inversely associated with MM overall and among females (longitudinally-updated HR per interquartile range increase: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.86) but not males (1.08; 0.90, 1.29). Our results do not confirm an inverse association of adult ambient UVR levels with NHL risk.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in VDR alter its functions to affect the vitamin D status. This raises the question of whether VDR gene polymorphisms are associated with MM risk, which has been investigated in case‒control studies, but the results have been inconsistent. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the relationship between VDR gene polymorphisms and MM risk. The PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journal (VIP), Wanfang Databases (WANFANG) were searched from inception to June 1, 2023, without language restriction or publication preference. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each variable were calculated. Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the source of heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed using Begg&rsquo; and Egger&rsquo;s tests, and the trim-and-fill method was used to compensate for publication bias. The correlation meta-analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.0 and STATA 12.0 software. All the included studies were based on Asian populations and involved four VDR gene polymorphisms, TaqI (rs731236), ApaI (rs7975232), BsmI (rs1544410) and FokI (rs2228570).</p><p>The results showed that</p><ul><li><p>TaqI (C vs. T: OR = 1.487, 95% CI 1.052, 2.104, P = 0.025;</p></li><li><p>CC + CT vs. TT: OR = 1.830, 95% CI 1.138, 2.944, P = 0.013),</p></li><li><p>ApaI (T vs. G: OR = 1.292, 95% CI 1.101, 1.517, P = 0.002;</p></li><li><p>TT vs. GG: OR = 1.600, 95% CI 1.106, 2.314, P = 0.013;</p></li><li><p>TG vs. GG: OR 1.305, 95% CI 1.050, 1.622; P = 0.016;</p></li><li><p>TT + TG vs. GG: OR = 1.353, 95% CI 1.103, 1.662, P = 0.004),</p></li><li><p>BsmI (GG vs. AA: OR = 1.918, 95% CI 1.293, 2.844, P = 0.001;</p></li><li><p>GA vs. AA: OR = 1.333, 95% CI 1.058, 1.679, P = 0.015;</p></li><li><p>G vs. A: OR = 1.398, 95% CI 1.180, 1.657, P = 0.000;</p></li><li><p>GG vs. AA + GA: OR = 1.686, 95% CI 1.174, 2.423, P = 0.005), and</p></li><li><p>FokI (T vs. C: OR = 1.687, 95% CI 1.474, 1.931, P = 0.000;</p></li><li><p>TT vs. CC: OR = 2.829, 95% CI 2.066, 3.872, P = 0.000;</p></li><li><p>TC vs. CC: OR = 1.579, 95% CI 1.304, 1.913, P = 0.000,</p></li><li><p>TT + TC vs. CC: OR = 1.771, 95% CI 1.477, 2.125, P = 0.000;</p></li><li><p>TT vs. CC + TC: OR = 2.409, 95% CI 1.814, 3.200, P = 0.000)</p></li></ul><p>are associated with MM risk.</p><p>VDR gene polymorphisms including ApaI, BsmI, TaqI, and FokI are associated with MM risk in Asian populations.</p><p>Additional studies with large sample sizes and different ethnicities are needed.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/multiple-myeloma-meta-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=multiple-myeloma-abut-50-worse-if-vitamin-d-deficient---april-2024>Multiple Myeloma abut 50% worse if Vitamin D Deficient - April 2024</h4><p><strong>Prevalence, Outcomes, and Complications of Vitamin D Deficiency Among Patients with Multiple Myeloma: Nationwide Burden of Disease</strong></p><p>J Investig Med. 2024 Apr 17:10815589241249998. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1177/10815589241249998>doi: 10.1177/10815589241249998</a> PDF behind paywall</p><p>Rahul Gujarathi 1, Manisha Rakesh Lakhanpal 2, Nikhila Chelikam 3, Divesh Manjani 4, Simmy Lahori 5, Sai Anusha Akella 6, Prashanth Gumpu Shivashankar 7, Francis Vino Dominic Savio 8, Abdirazak Ibrahim Ali 9, Navyatha Annareddy 10, Aryak Singh 11, Lokesh Manjani 12, Prasanthi Vanga 13, Avinash Adiga 14</p><p>Multiple myeloma (MM), constituting 10% of hematological malignancies, poses significant morbidity and mortality, especially with skeletal involvement.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among Japanese MM patients and its correlation with clinical outcomes.</p><p>Methods: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels were assessed in 68 MM patients at a single institution in Japan, analyzing their association with clinical status, laboratory parameters including procollagen type 1 N-propeptide (P1NP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b), health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) scores, and overall survival. Additionally, patients with suboptimal 25(OH)D levels received cholecalciferol supplementation <strong>(1000 IU/day)</strong> , and changes in laboratory parameters were monitored.</p><p>Results: The median 25(OH)D level was 22 ng/ml, with 32% and 51% of patients exhibiting vitamin D deficiency (&lt; 20 ng/ml) and insufficiency (20-29 ng/ml), respectively. The 25(OH)D levels were unrelated to sex, age, MM stage, or bone lesions, but the vitamin D-deficient group showed a tendency towards lower HR-QOL scores.</p><p>Among patients achieving complete remission, vitamin D supplementation increased P1NP, while TRACP-5b remained unchanged. Overall survivals from vitamin D measurement and from MM diagnosis were significantly worse in the vitamin D-deficient group compared to the vitamin D-insufficient/-sufficient group.</p><p>Conclusion: The study identified a considerable number of Japanese MM patients with insufficient serum vitamin D levels, with one-third being deficient. Additionally, vitamin D deficiency predicted poor overall survival in Japanese MM patients. Further investigation is required to determine whether vitamin D supplementation can improve the frailty and survival of vitamin D-deficient MM patients.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/multiple-myeloma-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=multiple-myeloma-associated-with-low-vitamin-d---meta-analysis-july-2023>Multiple Myeloma associated with low vitamin D - meta-analysis July 2023</h4><p><strong>The Global Prevalence of Vitamin D Deficiency and Insufficiency in Patients with Multiple Myeloma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</strong></p><p>Nutrients . 2023 Jul 20;15(14):3227. <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15143227.>doi: 10.3390/nu15143227.</a></p><p>Nor Hayati Ismail 1, Ali Mussa 1 2, Mutaz Jamal Al-Khreisat 1, Shafini Mohamed Yusoff 1, Azlan Husin 3, Muhammad Farid Johan 1, Md Asiful Islam 4</p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/mm-chart.jpg alt=image width=500><p>Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by the exponential growth of malignant plasma cells. Individuals diagnosed with MM exhibit a deficiency in vitamin D and may suffer fatigue, a loss of muscular strength, persistent musculoskeletal aches, and pain. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in individuals diagnosed with MM.</p><p>Methods: We searched five electronic databases using relevant keywords. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the critical appraisal tool developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. We employed a random-effects model and presented the findings in the form of percentages accompanied by 95% confidence intervals (CI). This protocol has been officially registered in PROSPERO under the registration number CRD42021248710.</p><p>Results: The meta-analysis comprised a total of eighteen studies and found that, among patients with MM, the occurrence of serum vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency was 39.4% (95% CI: 25.8 to 52.9, n = 3746) and 34.1% (95% CI: 20.9 to 47.2, n = 3559), respectively. The findings indicate that a greater proportion of newly diagnosed patients exhibited vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency, with rates of 43.0% and 41.6%, respectively, compared to those receiving treatment (rates of 41.6% and 32.3%, respectively). The findings of the sensitivity analyses were consistent, and most of the studies (72.2%) were deemed to be of high quality. The results of Egger&rsquo;s test indicated the absence of publication bias.</p><p>Conclusions: Patients diagnosed with MM have been found to exhibit significantly elevated levels of both vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency. Therefore, it is recommended to consider vitamin D testing as an additional parameter in the current criteria for the clinical evaluation of MM.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/mm-meta-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-and-multiple-myeloma-a-scoping-review---march-2023>Vitamin D and Multiple Myeloma: A Scoping Review - March 2023</h4><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/multiple-myeloma-march-2023.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=multiple-myeloma-mean-vitamin-d-level--span-stylecolorf005-ngspan---dec-2020>Multiple myeloma: Mean Vitamin D level = <span style=color:red>5 ng</span> - Dec 2020</h4><p><strong>Serum Levels of Vitamin D in Patients with Multiple Myeloma</strong></p><p>Folia Med (Plovdiv) . 2020 Dec 31;62(4):730-735. <a href=https://doi.org/10.3897/folmed.62.e50321>doi: 10.3897/folmed.62.e50321</a></p><p>Discusses better response to treatment if have higher level of vitamin D</p><p>. <strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/mm-dec-2020.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=far-better-mm-survival-when-getting-just-10000-iu-of-vitamin-d-per-week---oct-2015>Far better MM survival when getting just 10,000 IU of Vitamin D per WEEK - Oct 2015</h4><p><strong>Prevalence, Supplementation, and Impact of Vitamin D Deficiency in Multiple Myeloma Patients.</strong></p><p>Cancer Invest. 2015 Oct 27:1-5. <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span></p><p><strong>Group given the most vitamin D had the best survival</strong></p><p><strong>     However, results were not statistically significant (too small of study)</strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/mm-survival.jpg alt=image><p><strong>Note: Dose size was only about 10,000 IU per WEEK - which they realized at the end of the study was far too little</strong></p><p>Lauter B1, Schmidt-Wolf IG1.</p><p>1a Department of Internal Medicine III, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO), University Hospital Bonn , Bonn , Germany.</p><p>Here, we studied 83 unselected multiple myeloma patients from December 2007 through December 2014.</p><ul><li>Lower 25(OH) D levels (&lt;10 ng/mL) were associated with higher number of plasma cells in the bone marrow.</li></ul><p><strong>Supplementation of vitamin D</strong> was accompanied with a significant increase in</p><ul><li><p>hemoglobin (11.8 to 12.3 p = .039),</p></li><li><p>leukocyte (4.9 to 5.8 p = .011), and</p></li><li><p>erythrocyte (3.8 to 4.0 p = .004) levels,</p></li></ul><p>while thrombocytes (200.5 to 175.2 p = .036) decreased.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study found a high incidence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in MM patients.

Bhata, Syed Nisarb, Zafar Amin Shaha, , ,</p><p>Background: Vitamin D regulates many biological processes including bone metabolism, innate immune response, and cell proliferation and differentiation by binding to its receptor VDR. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms have been associated with many cancers like breast, colorectal, prostate, and skin. The main aim of this study was to determine whether VDR polymorphisms (ApaI, BsmI and FokI) are associated with increased risk of multiple myeloma.</p><p>Methods: We designed a case control study where 75 multiple myeloma cases were studied for VDR polymorphisms (ApaI, BsmI and FokI) against 150 controls taken from general population. The polymorphisms of VDR gene were investigated using PCR–RFLP method.</p><p>Results: We did not find any significant association between ApaI and BsmI polymorphisms and multiple myeloma risk (P > 0.05), but FokI polymorphism was significantly associated with increased risk for multiple myeloma. We also found a significant association between the ff variant genotype with creatinine levels, albumin levels, and Durie–Salmon stage III.</p><p>Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the FokI polymorphism is involved in the increased susceptibility to development and progression in multiple myeloma in the ethnic Kashmiri population. Furthermore these results suggest that ff genotype is associated with higher risk for developing multiple myeloma.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/elsevier/role-of-vitamin-d-receptor-vdr-polymorphisms-in-susceptibility-to-W0feYmG6Mb?key=elsevier">PDF (which has the 5.3 X factor) can be rented at DeepDyve</a></strong></p><p><strong>See <a href=/posts/vitamin-d-receptor>Vitamin D Receptor</a> in VitaminDWiki</strong></p><p><strong><span style=color:red>55 </span>health problems are greatly increased if poor VDR</strong></p><hr><h4 id=multiple-myeloma-2-x-more-likely-if-poor-vitamin-d-receptor---may-2019>Multiple myeloma 2 X more likely if poor Vitamin D Receptor - May 2019</h4><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/mm-2018-sci-hub.pdf>Download the PDF from sci-hub via VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=multiple-myeloma-more-common-in-areas-with-low-uvb-vitamin-d---2014>Multiple myeloma more common in areas with low UVB (Vitamin D) - 2014</h4><p><strong>Are low ultraviolet B and vitamin D associated with higher incidence of multiple myeloma?</strong></p><p>J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2015 Apr;148:245-52. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2014.12.005>doi: 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2014.12.005</a></p><p>Mohr SB1, Gorham ED1, Garland CF2, Grant WB3, Garland FC1, Cuomo RE4.</p><p>Author information</p><p>1Deartment of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States; Naval Health Research Center, San Diego, CA, United States.</p><p>2Deartment of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States.</p><p>3Sunlight, Nutrition, and Health Research Center, San Francisco, CA, United States.</p><p>4Deartment of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States; Graduate School of Public Health, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA, United States.

Multiple myeloma is the most common cancer to affect bone with up to 90% of patients developing bone lesions. Although several studies demonstrated that endocrine changes such as vitamin D deficiency promote secondary cancer growth in bone, relatively few have reported its prevalence. For this reason, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in patients with bone metastases and multiple myeloma.</p><p>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum 25-OH-D levels of patients with metastatic bone disease were measured on admission. Statistical analyses was performed to evaluate for possible confounders of hypo-vitaminosis D.</p><p>RESULTS: We found a widespread and alarming rate of vitamin D deficiency in patients with metastatic bone disease and multiple myeloma. Of note, patients with bone metastases due to breast cancer, prostate cancer and multiple myeloma rarely reached sufficient serum 25-OH-D levels.</p><p>CONCLUSION: It is of utmost clinical importance to assess vitamin D levels in cancer patients, especially in those with, or at high risk of developing metastatic bone disease.</p><hr><h4 id=see-also-vitamindwiki>See also VitaminDWiki</h4><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/blood-cell-cancer-is-associated-with-a-3x-worse-vitamin-d-receptor>Blood cell cancer is associated with a 3X worse Vitamin D Receptor – June 2019</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/overview-cancer-and-vitamin-d>Overview Cancer and vitamin D</a> has the following chart</p></li></ul><img src=/attachments/d3.mock.jpg alt=image><hr><h4 id=incidence-of-multiple-melanoma-doubled-in-30-years>Incidence of Multiple Melanoma doubled in 30 years</h4><p><a href=https://www.myelomacrowd.org/multiple-myeloma-cases-double-since-1990/>Myelomacrowd</a></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/mm-since-1990.png alt=image width=900><p>Increased obesity, dark skin, seniors, decreased vitamin D</p><hr><h4 id=wikipedia-on-multiple-myeloma>Wikipedia on Multiple Myeloma</h4><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma</a></p><ul><li><p>Multiple myeloma develops in 6.1 per 100,000 people per year</p></li><li><p>2nd most common hematological malignancy in the U.S.</p></li><li><p>The five year survival rate is 45%.(with treatment, 6 months if no treatment)</p></li><li><p>Is twice as common in African Americans (who have low levels of vitamin D) as it is in White Americans</p></li><li><p>Bone pain affects almost 70% of patients and is the most common symptom</p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=see-also-web>See also web</h4><ul><li><p>A Retrospective Analysis of the Prevalence and Clinical Outcomes of Vitamin D Deficiency in Myeloma Patients in Tropical Australia - March 2020 - DOI: 10.1007/s00520-019-04942-7,&ldquo;Patients with vitamin D deficiency had a higher likelihood of peripheral neuropathy compared with their non-vitamin D counterparts (73% vs. 33%, P = 0.03)&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>Vitamin D Receptor Gene Polymorphism Is Associated With Multiple Myeloma" Jan 2020, DOI: 10.1002/jcb.29135 <strong>3X more likely to have a poor Vitamin D Receptor</strong></p></li></ul></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/alcohol.html><span class=tag>alcohol</span></a>
