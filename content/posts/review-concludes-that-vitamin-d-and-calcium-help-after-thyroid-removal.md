Background Temporary hypocalcemia is a frequent complication after total thyroidectomy. Routine postoperative administration of vitamin D and calcium can reduce the incidence of symptomatic postoperative hypocalcemia. We undertook a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of this intervention.

Methods We identified randomized controlled trials comparing the administration of vitamin D or metabolites to oral calcium or no treatment in patients after total thyroidectomy in MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS databases.

Results Four studies with 706 patients were included: 346 in the calcitriol group, 288 in the oral calcium group and 72 in the control group. The rates of hypocalcemia symptoms were 4%, 19% and 31%, respectively. The OR value for the comparison between calcitriol + calcium as compared to no treatment and to exclusive calcium treatment groups was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.13– 0.79) and 0.31 (95% CI, 0.14– 0.70), respectively.

Conclusion The prophylactic treatment with vitamin D or metabolites + calcium is effective to decrease the incidence of symptoms of temporary hypocalcemia.

# Supplements added about 1 year of quality life to the person who had thyroidectomy

# Suspect that  if the supplements years were given years earlier that the thyroidectomy would not have been needed
