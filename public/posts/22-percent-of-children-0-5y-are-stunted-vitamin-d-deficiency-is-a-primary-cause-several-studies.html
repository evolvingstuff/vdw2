Stunting is one of the world&#39;s major nutritional problems particularly in developing countries, and is characterized by chronic growth and development impairment in children. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2022, the prevalence of stunting was 22.3%, or around 148.1 million. The direct cause of stunting is poor nutritional intake of both macronutrients and micronutrients. One crucial micronutrient for linear growth is vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency can cause developmental delays in children. Vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women and children may have beneficial effects in preventing stunting and promoting growth in children. The main objective of this study was to determine the role of vitamin D to prevent childrens stunting. This study is a literature review using PubMed and the Google database to identify articles published in the period 2015-2023. In conclusion, vitamin D has an important role to prevent childrens stunting.

Background

Stunting is a common nutritional problem in children. Many risk factors contributing to stunting are identified in the literature. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy is useful for preventing impairment of fetal bone growth in the womb. However, lack of review in exploring supplementation of prenatal vitamin D is related to stunting in children.

Purpose

This study aims to identify the effectiveness of prenatal vitamin D supplementation in preventing stunting.

Methods

A literature review was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library. Inclusion criteria were a randomized controlled trial study, published between 2011–2023, a full-text article for pregnant women and an independent variable supplement vitamin D to prevent children’s stunting. The keywords used in English were “children OR child” AND “pregnant women” AND “preventive stunting” AND “vitamin D”. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) appraisal tool.

Results

From the results of the study selection of 511 articles, 11 articles met the inclusion and eligibility criteria for study analysis. Four studies indicated that the administration of vitamin D did not influence the length of the neonate’s body or the Length for Age Z-Score (LAZ), used as an indicator of stunting. However, seven articles demonstrated that providing vitamin D supplements to pregnant women impacted various aspects of anthropometry, including the length of the neonate’s body. Our findings show that the dosage  **used of vitamin D in pregnancy varied between 1400–60,000 per week.**  Overall, results of this study analysis show that the intervention of prenatal vitamin D supplementation has an impact on the prevention of stunting.

Conclusion

This literature review highlighted the benefits of maternal vitamin D during pregnancy and for the children’s growth. Prenatal vitamin D supplementation is needed to prevent stunting.

!!!!The role of vitamin d to prevent children&#39;s stunting – March 2024

Stunting is one of the world&#39;s major nutritional problems particularly in developing countries, and is characterized by chronic growth and development impairment in children. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2022, the prevalence of stunting was 22.3%, or around 148.1 million. The direct cause of stunting is poor nutritional intake of both macronutrients and micronutrients. One crucial micronutrient for linear growth is vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency can cause developmental delays in children. Vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women and children may have beneficial effects in preventing stunting and promoting growth in children. The main objective of this study was to determine the role of vitamin D to prevent childrens stunting. This study is a literature review using PubMed and the Google database to identify articles published in the period 2015-2023. In conclusion, vitamin D has an important role to prevent childrens stunting. The effect of vitamin D deficiency on the process of bone growth in stunted toddlers is inhibited by inhibiting the function of IGF-1 in increasing osteoblastogenesis, thereby reducing the rate of bone growth. Stunting can be prevented early on through the adequate intake of macro and micronutrient nutrients. The need for micronutrients is especially important, including vitamin D as an important element in bone metabolism.

Background
Stunting is a common nutritional problem in children. Many risk factors contributing to stunting are identified in the literature. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy is useful for preventing impairment of fetal bone growth in the womb. However, lack of review in exploring supplementation of prenatal vitamin D is related to stunting in children.

Purpose
This study aims to identify the effectiveness of prenatal vitamin D supplementation in preventing stunting.

Methods
A literature review was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library. Inclusion criteria were a randomized controlled trial study, published between 2011–2023, a full-text article for pregnant women and an independent variable supplement vitamin D to prevent children’s stunting. The keywords used in English were “children OR child” AND “pregnant women” AND “preventive stunting” AND “vitamin D”. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) appraisal tool.

Results
From the results of the study selection of 511 articles, 11 articles met the inclusion and eligibility criteria for study analysis. Four studies indicated that the administration of vitamin D did not influence the length of the neonate’s body or the Length for Age Z-Score (LAZ), used as an indicator of stunting. However, seven articles demonstrated that providing vitamin D supplements to pregnant women impacted various aspects of anthropometry, including the length of the neonate’s body. Our findings show that the dosage __used of vitamin D in pregnancy varied between 1400–60,000 per week.__ Overall, results of this study analysis show that the intervention of prenatal vitamin D supplementation has an impact on the prevention of stunting.

Conclusion
This literature review highlighted the benefits of maternal vitamin D during pregnancy and for the children’s growth. Prenatal vitamin D supplementation is needed to prevent stunting.
