Multiple sclerosis (MS) presents with  **optic neuritis (ON)**  in 20 % of cases and 50 % of ON patients develop MS within 15 years. 

In this study, we evaluated the preventive effects of vitamin D3 administration on the  **conversion of ON to MS** (primary outcome) and on the MRI lesions (secondary outcome) of ON patients with low serum 25 (OH) D levels. Thirty ON patients (15 in each of 2 groups, aged 20-40 years) with serum 25 (OH) D levels of less than 30 ng/ml were enrolled in a double blind, randomized, parallel-group trial. The treatment group (cases) received 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 weekly for 12 months and the control group (controls) received a placebo weekly for 12 months. Finally, the subsequent relapse rate and changes in MRI plaques were compared between the two groups. Risk reduction was 68.4 % for the primary outcome in the treatment group (relative risk = 0.316, p = 0.007). 

After 12 months, patients in the treatment group had a significantly lower incidence rate of cortical, juxtacortical, corpus callosal, new T2, new gadolinium-enhancing lesions and black holes. The mean number of total plaques showed a marginally significant decrease in the group receiving vitamin D3 supplementation as compared with the placebo group (p = 0.092). Administration of vitamin D3 supplements to ON patients with low serum vitamin 25 (OH) D levels may delay the onset of a second clinical attack and the subsequent conversion to MS.

* 3 books with sections on MS and vitamin D

* Vitamin D found to be [far better than FDA drug for MS](/tags/far-better-than-fda-drug-for-ms.html)

* Many MS websites are very pro vitamin D

* People at risk of having low vitamin D (elderly, women, blacks,...) have greater incidence of MS
