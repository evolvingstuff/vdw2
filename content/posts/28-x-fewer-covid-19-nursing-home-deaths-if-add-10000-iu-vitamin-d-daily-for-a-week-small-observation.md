On reviewing a simple intervention in a nursing home on my patients I had a second look into the situation on a ward that was otherwise devastated. I had to make sure this is true since I had a hard time believing it myself.

On a ward with 67 patients that would normally have 74 residents COVID 19 struck and at the end of it 28 patients died or **42%** 

I had 13 of these patients and along with the COVID protocol used in all patients who became sick I also gave them 10,000IU of vitamin D daily for a week and then resumed the usual dose of 2000IU daily. 

Only 2 died or a  **15 %**  death rate! My population was similar to others on the ward and I fully expected 2 males who have morbid obesity/comorbidities  to succumb but they did not. Is this statistically significant…. I’m not sure but this is quite a surprising difference.  The only intervention aside from usual COVID care was the vitamin D.  All my patients normally get 2000IU daily in the nursing home after a study reported that 94% of residents have adequate levels of vitamin D after a few months. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20440692/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20440692/) &nbsp; (5 months - <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/schwalfenberg2010-sci-hub.pdf">PDF from sci-hub</a>)

Vitamin D deficiency is common especially in nursing homes and in the winter in the general population in northern latitudes.  Levels required for proper immune function are considerably higher (25(OH)D about 100-150nmol/l) Our bones do ok on much less,

This simple intervention for a modifiable risk factor is safe , cheap, and effective when used right at the onset of disease.  Timing is everything.  Once the cytokine storm is well under way it is difficult to reverse.

 **Follow-on email #1: Not allowed to get Vitamin D tests (Canada, etc)** 

We are unable to do tests on vitamin D, our public system only allows testing where we suspect metabolic bone disease

 **Follow-on email #2: unable to prescribe what was needed** 

All residents under my care are on 2000iu daily achieving good levels as in our study a few years ago after a few months, using the  **<span style="color:#F00;">hammer</span>**  as I wrote about would have been preferable however  **pharmacy  was resistant/reluctant to use this**  but complied with this request Started on 10,000 the day of  positive COVID test or the next day ....
