#### Restless legs syndrome (Willis-Ekbom disease) and growing pains: are they the same thing?

There has been no previous side-by-side comparison of the diagnostic criteria for restless legs syndrome (RLS)(Willis-Ekbom disease) and growing pains. In our review, we explore this comparison emphasizing overlaps and disconnects, summarize recent literature exploring the relationship between the 2 entities, and make suggestions for future research.

There is considerable overlap in the diagnostic criteria for childhood RLS and growing pains. The literature also indicates that RLS and growing pains more commonly occur together than one would expect based on chance alone, and the family histories of RLS and growing pains often are overlapping. Leg rubbing to obtain relief from leg discomfort is common to both disorders, though walking to obtain relief seems unique to RLS. Childhood RLS also has been reported to be painful in up to 45% of cases.

The development of standard diagnostic criteria is necessary to move forward in the field of growing pains research. A quantitative and validated rating scale for growing pains severity already exists. Because of  the clinical and genetic similarity between RLS and growing pains, studies that parallel those previously performed in RLS patients are recommended for growing pains patients. For example, a genome wide association study in growing pains patients of all possible genes with particular attention to those identified as related to RLS and a therapeutic trial of medications known to be effective in RLS would be welcome.  **<span style="color:#00F;">Abnormalities in vitamin D metabolism also may be common to both disorders.</span>**

### Every feature of Restless Legs is common with Growing Pains

### Clipped from the PDF

Vitamin D is said to be deficient in both disorders <sup>[37,38]</sup> and vitamin D–binding protein is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of RLS patients <sup>[39]</sup>; therefore, further exploration of the role of vitamin D in both disorders also is warranted.
