Vitamin D deficiency is common and implicated in risk of several human diseases. Evidence on the relative quantitative contribution of environmental, genetic and phenotypic factors to vitamin D status (assessed by the serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 25(OH)D) in free-living populations is sparse. 

We conducted a cross-sectional study of 494 Caucasian adults aged 18–61 years, randomly selected from the Australian Electoral Roll according to groups defined by age, sex and region (spanning 27°-43°South). Data collected included personal characteristics, sun exposure behaviour, biomarkers of skin type and past sun exposure, serum 25(OH)D concentration and candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms. 

 **Ambient ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels in the month six weeks before blood sampling best predicted vitamin D status.** 

Serum 25(OH)D concentration increased by 10nmol/L as reported time in the sun doubled. 

Overall, 54% of the variation in serum 25(OH)D concentration could be accounted for: 

* 36% of the variation was explained by sun exposure-related factors; 

* 14% by genetic factors (including epistasis) and 

* 3.5% by direct measures of skin phenotype. 

Novel findings from this study are demonstration of gene epistasis, and quantification of the relative contribution of a wide range of environmental, constitutional and genetic factors to vitamin D status. Ambient UVR levels and time in the sun were of prime importance but it is nonetheless important to include the contribution of genetic factors when considering sun exposure effects.

### Highlights

* Ambient ultraviolet radiation six weeks prior to blood sampling best predicted vitamin D status. 

* Time in the sun predicts serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in a logarithmic association. 

* Environmental, phenotypic and genetic factors explained over 50% of the variation in vitamin D. 

* The most important environmental predictor was ambient ultraviolet radiation. 

* Gene epistasis in vitamin D pathway geneshas a significant influence on vitamin D status.
