## High-intensity aquatic exercises (HydrOS) improve physical function and reduce falls among postmenopausal women.

Menopause. 2013 Mar 25.

3 Exercise Research Laboratory, School of Physical Education, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effects of an aquatic exercise program (HydrOS) on neuromuscular function and falls among postmenopausal women.

METHODS: One hundred eight postmenopausal women (mean <span>[SD]</span> age, 58.8 <span>[6.4]</span> y) were randomly divided into the control group (CG; n = 44) and the aquatic exercise group (AEG; n = 64). Both groups received elementary  **calcium 500 mg/day and cholecalciferol 1,000 IU/day** . For 24 weeks, the AEG participated in the aquatic exercise program, whereas the  **CG remained sedentary** . The following variables were measured before and after the program: number of falls and fallers (7 mo before and after the intervention); flexibility, using Wells' Sit-and-Reach Test (FLEX); static balance, using the Unipedal Stance Test (UST); mobility, using the Timed-Up-and-Go test (TUG); handgrip strength of the dominant hand (HGS); and maximal isometric strength of back extensor muscles (SBE), strength of hip flexor muscles (SHF), and strength of knee extensor muscles (SKE). The  **muscle strength tests were considered the primary outcome** , whereas the other neuromuscular tests, together with falls, were considered secondary outcomes. Results were significant when P ≤ 0.05.

RESULTS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D significantly increased by 21% in the CG and by 23% in the AEG (P < 0.001). The number of falls and fallers after the program remained unchanged in the CG; in the AEG, the mean number of falls decreased from 2.00 to 0.29 (P < 0.0001), and the number of fallers decreased by 44% (P < 0.0001). 

All neuromuscular variables significantly improved in the AEG: FLEX (26.6%; P < 0.0001), UST (14.1%; P < 0.001), TUG (23.7%; P < 0.001), HGS (13.4%; P < 0.001), SBE (26.2%; P < 0.001), SHF (18.5%; P = 0.039), and SKE (7.7%; P < 0.001). 

In the CG, significant improvements in FLEX (12.2%; P = 0.009), UST (4.5%; P < 0.001), TUG (10%; P < 0.001), and SHF (5.7%; P = 0.039) were observed and could be explained by increasing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level attributable to supplementation.

CONCLUSIONS: The aquatic exercise program HydrOS is a safe and efficient way to improve physical function and to reduce falls among postmenopausal women.

### Could have greatly improved results by:

* Using more vitamin D, not just 1,000 IU - many participants probably did not get any increase in serum levels of vitamin D

* Using a loading dose - many participants probably did not get vitamin D benefit until near the end of the study

* Using cofactors to build bones - such as Magnesium and Vitamin K2

* Using Omega-3 - see below
