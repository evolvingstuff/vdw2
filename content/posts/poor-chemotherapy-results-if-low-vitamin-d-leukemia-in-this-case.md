Vitamin D deficiency(<20 ng/mL) is a common condition, associated with an inferior prognosis in some cancers. However, the prognostic significance of vitamin D deficiency in acute leukemia is largely unknown. The present study aimed to assess the baseline status of vitamin D <span>[25-(OH) D3]</span> and find its association with induction remission rate and mortality using standard chemotherapy in patients with acute leukemia. In this prospective observational study, blood samples were collected from 73 newly diagnosed patients before starting induction chemotherapy to measure serum vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels along with routine investigations.44/73 (60.3%) patients were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 29/77 (39.7%) were acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Descriptive statistics and frequency distribution were used in SPSS software, and Pearson’s chi-squared test compared the categorical variables. Post-induction remission status (complete and incomplete remission) and induction-related mortality were correlated with vitamin D levels. 44/73 patients (60.3%) included in this study were males, and the remaining were females. The mean age of the participants was 30.32 ± 14.95 years. The mean serum vitamin D level in the cohort was 15.74 ± 28.14 ng/mL. Vitamin D deficiency was observed in 59/73 (80.8%) patients, whereas 14/73 (19.2%) had normal levels (≥20ng/mL) of the vitamin. Vitamin D deficiency is common among acute leukemia patients. Herein, we observed that  **low vitamin D level is associated with higher rates of incomplete remission in acute leukemia patients (P = 0.016)** . Vitamin D deficiency is common among acute leukemia patients and is associated with poor short-term outcomes.
