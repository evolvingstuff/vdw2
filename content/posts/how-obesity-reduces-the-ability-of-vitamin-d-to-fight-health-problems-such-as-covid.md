Subclinical inflammation in morbid obesity is associated with immune activation and the development of concomitant diseases. Impaired immune homeostasis and immune cell dysregulation in adipose tissue are associated with phenotypic and functional changes in the pool of T lymphocytes and the development of chronic hypovitaminosis D. Low vitamin D levels in obesity lead to the activation, proliferation and production of pro-inflammatory mediators by T cells. Hypovitaminosis D is the cause of a decrease in the functional potential of regulatory and anti-inflammatory lymphocytes and the maintenance of the inflammatory response. The exact molecular genetic mechanisms of the effect of vitamin D on T lymphocytes have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, uncovering the functional role of T cells and their relationship to vitamin D homeostasis in the context of obesity development may contribute to the development of new pathogenetic methods for clinical prediction of the risk of metabolic, oncologic, autoimmune and infectious complications. The review presents the molecular genetic mechanisms of the effect of vitamin D on adipose tissue resident T lymphocytes and the characteristics of vitamin D receptor expression, and analyzes the phenotypic and functional characteristics of potentially pathogenic T lymphocytes in relation to the development of obesity and its associated
