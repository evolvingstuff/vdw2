#### [Doctors Begin to Crack Covid’s Mysterious Long-Term Effects](https://www.wsj.com/articles/doctors-begin-to-crack-covids-mysterious-long-term-effects-11604252961)

* “Other viral outbreaks, including the original SARS, MERS, Ebola, H1N1 and the Spanish flu, have been associated with long-term symptoms. Scientists reported that some patients experienced fatigue, sleep problems and joint and muscle pain long after their bodies cleared a virus, [according to a recent review chronicling the long-term effects of viral infections](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/21641846.2020.1778227).

* “Some of the most compelling evidence for the inflammation theory comes from Covid-19 patients [with signs of heart inflammation and injury months after illness](https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-covid-19-patients-show-signs-of-heart-damage-months-later-11600866000). One study [looking at 100 Covid-19 patients two months after getting sick](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2768916) found that 78 had abnormal findings on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, while 60 had cardiac MRIs indicating heart-muscle inflammation. The study included hospitalized, nonhospitalized and asymptomatic patients.”

* “Another possibility is that the virus causes some people’s immune systems to attack and damage their own organs and tissues, researchers said. A June study found  **roughly half**  of 29 hospitalized ICU patients with Covid-19 [had one or more types of autoantibodies](https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2020/06/24/annrheumdis-2020-218009)—antibodies that mistakenly target and attack a patient’s own tissues or organs.”

* Of the Long haul COVID-19 patients…” About 90% of such patients report having symptoms of exercise intolerance, fatigue and elevated heartbeats. About 40% to 50% also report symptoms such as gastrointestinal issues, headaches and shortness of breath."

* “. A 2009 study of 233 SARS survivors [found 27% met criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome four years after getting sick](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/415378).”

* "Our results show that 43.4% of COVID-19+ cases have symptoms lasting longer than 30 days, and 24.1% still have at least one symptom after 90 days. "

* "These numbers are higher for COVID-19+ cases who were initially more ill, 59.4% at 30 days and 40.6% at 90 days, "

* "but even for very mild and initially asymptomatic cases, 14.3% have complications persist for 30 days or longer."
