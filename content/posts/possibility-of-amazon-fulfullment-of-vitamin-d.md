## VitaminDWiki is exploring the possibility of distributing vitamin D via Amazon

Amazon fulfillment provides a very low-cost way to distribute a product around the world 

They can sell, package, label, and ship a product weighing less than 1 pound for just $1.32

### Amazon fulfillment could be used for

1. Selling vitamin D sample pack - so that people can experience vitamin D for themselves

1. Distributing Vitamin D thru employeers or Health Maintenance Organizations

> Participants could order vitamin D, cofactors, etc delivered to home, and billed to a third party - such as employeer, HMO
