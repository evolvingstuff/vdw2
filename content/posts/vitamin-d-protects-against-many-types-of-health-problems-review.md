BACKGROUND: Optimal vitamin D intake and its status are important not only for bone and calcium-phosphate metabolism, but also for overall health and well-being. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency as a global health problem are likely to be a risk for wide spectrum of acute and chronic illnesses.

METHODS: A review of randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other evidence of vitamin D action on various health outcomes.

RESULTS: Adequate vitamin D status seems to be protective against 

* musculoskeletal disorders (muscle weakness, falls, fractures), 

* infectious diseases, 

* autoimmune diseases, 

* cardiovascular disease, 

* type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, 

* several types of cancer, 

* neurocognitive dysfunction and mental illness, and other diseases, as well as 

* infertility and 

* adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. 

Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is associated with  **all-cause mortality** .

CONCLUSIONS: Adequate vitamin D supplementation and sensible sunlight exposure to reach optimal vitamin D status are among the front line factors of prophylaxis for the spectrum of disorders. Supplementation guidance and population strategies for the eradication of vitamin D deficiency must be included in the priorities of physicians, medical professionals and healthcare policy-makers.
