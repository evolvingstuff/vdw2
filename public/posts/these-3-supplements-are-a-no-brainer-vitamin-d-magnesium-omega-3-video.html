2024</h4><p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2_qNJWZ_tw">YouTube</a></strong></p><p>Last week a sales rep who&rsquo;s about my age was in my office and we were talking about how difficult it is to try and stay healthy she asked me well what do you take for supplements and I showed her on my desk I take this that and the other and she said oh my doctor checked that a couple years ago I&rsquo;m fine and I said oh no no you should definitely be checking that several times a year to make sure it&rsquo;s as high as it should be so I pulled out testing kits we PR our fingers tested our labs and sent them in and the results were far from ideal we were both disappointed let&rsquo;s start with number three of my top three supplements and it is one of the ones that we checked this supplement is <strong>omega-3</strong> when my friend and I checked this in our test it came back in the <strong>5.7 range and it should be north of eight</strong> the only folks that I&rsquo;ve ever seen keep it up north of eight in fact in the double digits were some of my sardine fans yes they ate sardines for a month and sure enough their number came back at above 13 so if you don&rsquo;t like to eat sardines every day <strong>Omega-3</strong> is very valuable in the way it improves our longevity specifically looking at the heart health your eye health and your brain health keeping that <strong>Omega-3</strong> High it is difficult when you first start taking foods that are high in <strong>Omega-3</strong> you&rsquo;ll find a universal complaint that everybody burps them up and indeed if you&rsquo;ve ever used sardines to try and raise your <strong>Omega-3</strong> that happens the absorption of the <strong>Omega-3</strong> is difficult and there are some things that you can do to improve it you could eat sardines for a week and your body would figure it out but most people don&rsquo;t tolerate that several of the supplements have reformulated the <strong>Omega-3</strong> to be a triglyceride form you&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s the right form because they advertise it and they charge you for it it does take more expense to unwind that supplement from its natural form and put it back together in the more absorbable less Burpee way so a triglyceride form of <strong>Omega-3</strong> is a valuable and potent way to raise your health score 95% of all Americans are deficient and unless you&rsquo;re in Japan or eating like people from Japan you&rsquo;re probably going to need to supplement or several of those cans of sardines but most importantly you should take this with other fats that does help the absorption even if it&rsquo;s not that triglyceride form so the second supplement is one that I actually didn&rsquo;t test in the blood test and I often don&rsquo;t test it in patients the importance of <strong>Magnesium</strong> is abundant from mental health to neuroplasticity to the synaptic function of your muscle cells in other words without it you get cramping and with it you get a better functioning of your muscle cells to the way you sleep uh the list is endless on how important <strong>Magnesium</strong> is and if you&rsquo;re going to place bets bet that you&rsquo;re deficient unless you&rsquo;re taking supplement months regularly of <strong>Magnesium</strong> almost everyone is deficient I can feel the deficiency sneak up every week in my life when I fast I take the supplements and I am trying to get ahead but I fast every week and when I get to that 48 hours to to 60 hours of fasting my body has diuresed it has removed excess fluid now this is a good thing for me at 52 years old but it also sweeps out a bunch of <strong>Magnesium</strong> so any excess that I had on board is probably in the toilet and this book by Dr James Nicol anonio is an excellent read but is a to when you look into his resources and the sites that really outline which form of <strong>Magnesium</strong> should you take I&rsquo;m a big fan of the <strong>Magnesium</strong> L3 and 8 but it is the most expensive in preparation for this video we ordered several supplements and one of them was <strong>Magnesium</strong> 3 and8 in the gummy form now now this was not my idea but in the name of science I had a few it chopped my blood sugar up to 200 and the food craving was actually a little hard for me to resist so I ended up taking too many which then gave me diarrhea so my supplement ended up in the toilet take those <strong>Magnesium</strong> supplements regularly and if you want the ones that are slow on the gut easy on cost I use a slow Meg I usually take one of those on the days when I&rsquo;m not fasting and two on the days when I&rsquo;m fasting and the most important supplement that I take that I really work hard at elevating is <strong>vitamin d</strong> yeah <strong>vitamin d</strong> is not just a vitamin it&rsquo;s a hormone and when my friend and I sent in our results we were both woefully low we were in the mid-30s which may look like a normal level if you&rsquo;re looking at standard Labs but I aim for Peak brain performance I also know that if I get low on my <strong>vitamin d</strong> I tend to slump in energy in mood and sometimes get more illness than I like to admit the <strong>vitamin d</strong> that I strive for is 50 or above the reason I reach for that is I know that to repair any mental damage or to have that Peak brain performance 50 is the minimum viable product for the best functioning brain however I fall short frequently when I routinely take the supplement I do great but as I said earlier I&rsquo;m not the best at doing that I also live in Florida now so I keep thinking I should be able to get this from the the sun in another effort to try and raise my <strong>vitamin d</strong> I invested in a <strong>vitamin d</strong> lamp but apparently the only way that works is if you sit in front of it so I am trying to sit in front of my <strong>vitamin d</strong> lamp for about 5 to six minutes at least three times a week yet my <strong>vitamin d</strong> was only 38 so I have room to improve when you add <strong>vitamin d</strong> to our cells that hormone goes into the cell and then into the nucleus and it helps the nucleus transcribe the proteins that that cell is meant to deliver to your body so the superpower of cells like astrocytes in your brain are because of the proteins that are transcribed out of the nucleus they are delivered to the brain and allow you to have that Peak brain performance that same application is applied to Heart cells and bone cells and immune cells every single cell in our body needs the help of <strong>vitamin d</strong> to deliver the transcription proteins require D for their superpower for their ability to help our body it&rsquo;s why a minimum level of 50 is the goal that&rsquo;s what it takes to keep the brain from sinking backwards I seek to keep my <strong>vitamin d</strong> from 50 to 80 just for maintenance but when I&rsquo;m helping patients repair from a disease I want them pushing north of 70 there are folks that see it tip above a 100 and I just tell them they can slow down on the supplement the real best benefits appear to be somewhere between 50 and 100 and I hope you&rsquo;re doing a better job than I am at keeping it there the <strong>vitamin d</strong> the <strong>Omega-3</strong> those are powerful Replacements but if you want to see my favorite way of increasing <strong>Magnesium</strong> and the experience of somebody seeing a float for the first time check out this next video it&rsquo;s part of that American tradiction documentary that we did a couple years ago I&rsquo;ll see you there</p></article></div></div><script
