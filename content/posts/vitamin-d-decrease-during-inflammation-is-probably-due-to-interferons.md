#### Circulating interferon-γ correlates with 1,25(OH)D and the 1,25(OH)D-to-25(OH)D ratio.

Cytokine. 2012 Oct;60(1):23-6. [doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2012.05.015.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2012.05.015.) Epub 2012 Jun 15.

The mechanism responsible for the decrease in vitamin D status (i.e., plasma or serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration) during inflammatory stress is unknown in humans. 

Interferon (IFN)-γ is an inflammatory cytokine that regulates vitamin D metabolism in isolated immune cells, but data suggesting this regulation exists in vivo is lacking. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to associate circulating IFN-γ perturbations with 25(OH)D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D) alterations during inflammatory stress in young adults recovering from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. 

Plasma 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)D and IFN-γ concentrations were measured in fasting blood draw samples obtained from twelve-male patients pre-surgery and 90-m, 3-d and 7-d post-surgery. 25(OH)D decreased significantly (p<0.05) after surgery, and strikingly, tended to inversely correlate (r=-0.32, p=0.058) with IFN-γ changes from pre- to post- (i.e., 90-m, 3-d, and 7-d) surgery. Additionally, 1,25(OH)D (r=0.37, p<0.05) and the 1,25(OH)D-to-25(OH)D ratio (r=0.52, p<0.05) changes from pre- to post- (i.e., 90-m, 3-d, and 7-d) surgery correlated with those of IFN-γ. These are the first reported in vivo findings suggesting that the 25(OH)D decrease and conversion to 1,25(OH)D increase with increasing IFN-γ in the circulation. 

We conclude that IFN-γ contributes to the decrease in vitamin D and the conversion of vitamin D to its active hormonal form in the circulation during inflammatory insult in humans.

## Vitamin D sufficiency associates with an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines after intense exercise in humans. - Feb 2014

Cytokine. 2014 Feb;65(2):134-7. [doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2013.12.004.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2013.12.004.) Epub 2013 Dec 31.

The purpose of this study was to identify the influence of vitamin D status (insufficient vs. sufficient) on circulating cytokines and skeletal muscle strength after muscular injury. To induce muscular injury, one randomly selected leg (SSC) performed exercise consisting of repetitive eccentric-concentric contractions. The other leg served as the control. An averaged serum 25(OH)D concentration from two blood samples collected before exercise and on separate occasions was used to establish vitamin D insufficiency (<30ng/mL, n=6) and sufficiency (>30ng/mL, n=7) in young, adult males. Serum cytokine concentrations, single-leg peak isometric force, and single-leg peak power output were measured before and during the days following the exercise protocol. The serum IL-10 and IL-13 responses to muscular injury were significantly (both p<0.05) increased in the vitamin D sufficient group. The immediate and persistent (days) peak isometric force (p<0.05) and peak power output (p<0.05) deficits in the SSC leg after the exercise protocol were not ameliorated with vitamin D sufficiency. We conclude that vitamin D sufficiency increases the anti-inflammatory cytokine response to muscular injury.
