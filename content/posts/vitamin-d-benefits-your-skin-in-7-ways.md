* Anti-inflammatory: Vitamin D can help treat skin conditions like acne, eczema, and psoriasis. 

* Anti-aging: Vitamin D can help prevent skin aging by protecting against damage, reducing puffiness, and minimizing fine lines and wrinkles. 

* Moisturizing: Vitamin D3 can improve skin hydration.

* Antioxidant: Vitamin D can help neutralize free radicals, especially those caused by UV radiation. 

* Skin repair: Vitamin D can contribute to skin repair and enhance the skin's immune system. 

A lack of vitamin D can cause skin problems, such as:

* Dull complexion

* Dry, flaky skin 

Many cosmetic brands and dermatologists use vitamin D in night creams and moisturizers. 

Darker skin produces less vitamin D than lighter skin.  This is because melanin, the pigment that provides skin color, absorbs the UVR that initiates vitamin D synthesis.
