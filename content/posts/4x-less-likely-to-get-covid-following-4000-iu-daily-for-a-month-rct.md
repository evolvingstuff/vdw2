Background

. Associations between vitamin D (VD) deficiency and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been documented in cross-sectional population studies. Intervention studies in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 have failed to consistently document a beneficial effect.

Objective

. To determine the efficacy and safety of VD-supplementation in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in highly exposed individuals.

Methods

. A double-blind, parallel, randomized trial was conducted. Frontline healthcare workers from **four hospitals in Mexico City** , who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, were enrolled between  **July 15 and December 30, 2020** . Participants were randomly assigned to receive 4,000 IU VD (VDG) or placebo (PG) daily for 30 d. 

RT-PCR tests were taken at baseline and repeated if COVID-19 manifestations appeared during follow-up. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and antibody tests were measured at baseline and at day 45. Per-protocol and intention-to-treat analysis were conducted.

Results

. Of 321 recruited subjects, 94 VDG and 98 PG completed follow-up. SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was lower in VDG than in PG (6.4 vs. 24.5%, p <0.001). 

The risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection was lower in the VDG than in the PG ( **RR: 0.23** ; 95% CI: 0.09–0.55) and was associated with an increment in serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.82–0.93), independently of VD deficiency. No significant adverse events were identified.

Conclusions

. Our results suggest that VD-supplementation in highly exposed individuals prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection without serious AEs and regardless of VD status.
