Magnesium ion plays an important role in maintaining vascular functional integrity.. The Magnesium Depletion Score (MDS), serving as a novel metric for the assessment of magnesium deficiency, has not been thoroughly investigated for its association with stroke in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between the MDS index and stroke in CKD patients.</p><p>Methods</p><p>We conducted a cross-sectional population-based study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009–2016 to explore the impact of MDS on the stroke outcome of CKD patients. The primary outcome was the risk of stroke in CKD patients. Sample-weighted multivariate logistic regression was used in our analysis.</p><p>Results</p><p>In this study of 3,536 CKD patients from the database, we found an 8.6% prevalence of stroke with higher stroke risk in older individuals and males. Lower dietary magnesium intake and higher MDS scores were significantly associated with stroke risk. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a dose-dependent relationship between MDS scores and stroke likelihood, independent of demographic and clinical factors. Subgroup analysis confirmed these findings, particularly in those with hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, without significant interactions (all p > 0.05).</p><p>Conclusion: Magnesium depletion is independently associated with a heightened stroke risk in chronic kidney disease patients.</p><hr><h4 id=magnesium-deficiency-the-silent-killer-linked-to-a-4x-higher-death-rate---june-2024>Magnesium Deficiency: The Silent Killer Linked to a 4x Higher Death Rate - June 2024</h4><p><strong><a href=https://greenmedinfo.com/content/magnesium-deficiency-silent-killer-linked-4x-higher-death-rate>Green Med Info</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>&ldquo;The MDS: Your Magnesium Status Decoder&rdquo;</p><ul><li><p>&ldquo;This is where the Magnesium Depletion Score (MDS) comes in.

We then validated MDS for risk stratification and for associations with inflammation and mortality among >10,000 US adults (weighted: aged 48 ± 0.3 y, 47% men) in the NHANES, a nationally representative study. A proportional hazards regression model was used for associations between magnesium intake and the MDS with risks of total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.</p><p>Results: In the PPCCT, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for magnesium deficiency was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.76) for the model incorporating the MDS with sex and age compared with 0.53 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.67) for the model with serum magnesium alone. In the NHANES, mean serum C-reactive protein significantly increased with increasing MDS (P-trend &lt; 0.01) after adjusting for age and sex and other covariates, primarily among individuals with magnesium intake less than the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR; P-trend &lt; 0.05). Further, we found that low magnesium intake was longitudinally associated with increased risks of total and CVD mortality only among those with magnesium deficiency predicted by MDS. MDS was associated with increased risks of total and CVD mortality in a dose-response manner only among those with magnesium intake less than the EAR.</p><p>Conclusions: The MDS serves as a promising measure in identifying individuals with magnesium deficiency who may benefit from increased intake of magnesium to reduce risks of systemic inflammation and CVD mortality.

The weighted multivariate linear regression model was performed to assess the linear relationship between dietary Mg intake and osteoporosis. Further, the non-linear relationship was also characterized by smooth curve fitting (SCF) and weighted generalized additive model (GAM). In addition, the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for associations between the MDS and osteoporosis were assessed by weighted logistic regression models.</p><p>Results: After adjusting all covariates, the weighted multivariable linear regression models demonstrated that the dietary Mg intake negatively correlated with osteoporosis, especially in participants aged 55 years or older. In addition, the non-linear relationship characterized by SCF and weighted GAM showed that the dietary Mg intake presented an L-shaped association with osteoporosis among females aged 55 years or older. Moreover, the weighted logistic regression model demonstrated that compared with MDS 0, the OR between MDS ≥3 and osteoporosis was 2.987 (95% CI 1.904, 4.686) in the male-middle intake group. Moreover, compared with MDS 0, the ORs between MDS ≥3 and osteoporosis was 5.666 (95% CI 3.188, 10.069) in the female-low intake group and 1.691 (95% CI 1.394, 2.051) in the female-middle intake group.</p><p>Conclusion: The present study indicated that in people with a daily intake of Mg level below the recommended daily intake (RDI), the dietary Mg intake and Mg bioavailability represented by MDS have a negative correlation with osteoporosis. According to the results, the combination of MDS and dietary Mg intake may be more comprehensive and rigorous in screening the population with osteoporosis. Therefore, early monitoring and interventions for osteoporosis may be necessary for those with insufficient dietary Mg intake or high MDS scores.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/mds-osteo-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=mds-and-chronic-kidney-disease---2023>MDS and Chronic Kidney Disease - 2023</h4><p><strong>Magnesium Depletion Score is Associated with Long-Term Mortality in Chronic Kidney Diseases: A Prospective Population-Based Cohort Study</strong></p><p>Journal of Nephrology, Volume 36, pages 755–765, (2023) PDF behind paywall and in <a href="https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/springer-journals/magnesium-depletion-score-is-associated-with-long-term-mortality-in-BA4pzq6l0M?key=springer">DeepDyve</a></p><p>Saifu Yin, Zhaoxia Zhou, Tao Lin & Xianding Wang</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/mds-ckd.webp alt=image width=800><p>Background</p><p>Magnesium deficiency is common in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD) due to restricted magnesium intake and impaired magnesium reabsorption.

The present study intended to explore the association of MDS with mortality among hypertension (HTN) participants. In this cohort study, we utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) covering the years 2003 to 2018. MDS levels were categorized into three groups (lower: MDS = 0–1; middle: MDS = 2; higher: MDS = 3–5). Kaplan-Meier curves were employed to illustrate survival differences between groups with varying MDS levels. The relationship between MDS and mortality was assessed through weighted multivariate Cox regression models. Subgroup analyses, along with sensitivity analyses, were also conducted to further explore and validate the findings. This study encompassed 12,485 participants, recording 2537 all-cause deaths and 707 cardiovascular deaths. The Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that the higher MDS group had the highest rates of all-cause and cardiovascular death. (P &lt; 0.001). Controlling for all confounding variables, participants belonging to the higher MDS group demonstrated a substantially elevated risk of mortality in comparison to the lower MDS group (all-cause mortality: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10–1.54; cardiovascular mortality: HR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.19–2.22). There were no interaction factors found in subgroup analyses that affected the relationship between MDS and mortality, except for cardiovascular disease. The findings were confirmed to be robust through further sensitivity analyses. Higher MDS levels independently predict an elevated risk of mortality among US adults with HTN. Therefore, MDS may serve as a cost-effective and widely available prognostic marker for HTN.</p><hr><h4 id=mds-and-diabetes---jan-2024>MDS and Diabetes - Jan 2024</h4><p><strong>Associations of the magnesium depletion score and magnesium intake with diabetes among US adults: an analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2018</strong></p><p>Epidemiol Health. 2024; 46: e2024020 online 2024 Jan 10. <a href=https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2024020>doi: 10.4178/epih.e2024020</a></p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/mds-diabetes-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=high-mds-increases-risk-of--congestive-heart-failure-by-32-x---may-2023>High MDS increases risk of Congestive Heart Failure by 3.2 X - May 2023</h4><p><strong>Association of Magnesium Depletion Score with Congestive Heart Failure: Results from the NHANES 2007–2016</strong></p><p>Biological Trace Element Research Volume 202, pages 454–465, (2024) <a href="https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/springer-journal/association-of-magnesium-depletion-score-with-congestive-heart-failure-Dzlpgs0GSq?key=springer">DeepDyve</a></p><p>Diming Zhao, Pengfei Chen, Mingjian Chen, Liang Chen & Liqing Wang</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/mds-chf.webp alt=image width=500><p>The magnesium depletion score (MDS) is considered a new valuable and reliable predictor of body magnesium status. This study aimed to explore the association between MDS and congestive heart failure (CHF) among US adults. A total of 19,227 eligible participants from the 2007–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were enrolled in this study and then divided into three groups according to the level of MDS (none to low: MDS=0–1, middle: MDS=2, high: MDS=3–5). Sample-weighted logistic regression models were applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) exploring the independent relationship between MDS and CHF. The estimated prevalence of CHF increased with the increasing level of MDS (none to low: 0.86%, middle: 4.06%, high: 13.52%; P &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Compared to those in the none-to-low group, participants in the middle and high groups were at significantly higher risk of CHF after adjusting for various covariates (model 3: OR=1.55, 95%CI: 1.05–2.30, P &lt; 0.001; <strong>OR=3.20</strong> , 95%CI: 2.07–4.96, P &lt; 0.001; respectively). Subgroup analyses indicated that adequate dietary magnesium intake could reduce the risk of CHF in participants who did not meet the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for magnesium. Besides, there was an interaction between coronary artery disease and MDS on CHF (P for interaction &lt; 0.001). These findings indicated that MDS, a novel indicator estimating magnesium deficiency, is associated with the risk of CHF in non-institutionalized US civilians. Participants whose dietary magnesium intake reaches the RDA might be at lower risk.</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>alcohol</span>
