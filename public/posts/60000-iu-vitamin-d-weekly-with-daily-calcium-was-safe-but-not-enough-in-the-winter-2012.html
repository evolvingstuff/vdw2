They were supplemented with Cholecalciferol 9572 IU/day and elemental calcium 1 gm/day. At the end of the 2nd month, those who attained vitamin D sufficiency were supplemented with Cholecalciferol 3000 IU/day, and those who still did not attain vitamin D sufficiency with Cholecalciferol 5286 IU/day along with 1 gm elemental calcium and the latter were reassessed after three months.</p><p>Results: The mean ± SD of serum calcium, phosphorous, and alkaline phosphatase were in the normal range at baseline, 2 and 5 months of supplementation (P= NS). The baseline median (IQR-Interquartile range) of 25 OHD and PTH was 6 (4-11) ng/ml and 19.6 (33-62) pg/ml respectively. In 2nd month there was a threefold increase in 25 OHD levels 19.6 (14.6-28.75) ng/ml and a further 50% increase in 5th month of supplementation. PTH levels were suppressed by 38 % at 2nd month and remained stable at 5th month. <strong>At the end of the 5th month, 46% had attained vitamin D sufficiency, and 27% of subjects were still vitamin D insufficient.</strong></p><p>Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation based on recent ESCPG, even up to upper tolerable intake levels (UL), along with elemental calcium of 1gm/day, is safe and does not lead to hypercalcemia.</p><h3 id=introduction>Introduction</h3><p>Vitamin D is synthesized in adequate amounts on casual exposure of skin to sunlight to a radiation waveband of 290 - 315 nm in most humans <sup>[1,2]</sup>. The UVB photons are absorbed by the epidermal 7-dehydrocholesterol e(7-DHC) (provitamin D), which is rapidly converted to cholecalciferol (previtamin D3) by a temperature-dependent process. This previtamin D3 enters into the circulation bound to vitamin D binding protein (DBP). Previtamin D3 is converted into 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25 OH D) in the liver, which is biologically inert and requires hydroxylation in the kidney on carbon 1 by the enzyme 1 hydroxylase. The biologically active form of vitamin D is responsible for regulation of calcium and phosphate metabolism and is essential for maintaining bone health from infant to adult health. Vitamin D2 is from dietary sources. Vitamin D2 and D3 (D represents D2 and D3) are fat-soluble vitamins incorporated into chylomicrons and absorbed into the lymphatics. Serum 25 OH D levels are a reliable indicator of the vitamin D status of an individual. The optimal level of 25OH D to maintain skeletal health and maximal dietary absorption of calcium in the gut is accepted to be 30 ng/ml and is defined as vitamin D sufficiency <sup>[36]</sup>. A value of &lt;20 ng/ml is defined as vitamin D deficiency and values between 20 to 30 ng/ml are defined as vitamin D insufficiency.</p><p>The Indian subcontinent is situated between latitudes 37.6°N and 8.4°N, with plentiful sunlight throughout the year. Despite this fact, several studies from India have documented the widespread prevalence of hypovitaminosis D across the length and breadth of the country in all age groups <sup>[7]</sup>. Studies in South India have shown that rural agricultural laborers&rsquo; who have their torsos exposed to sunlight for more than 5-6 hours during their agricultural profession also have hypovitaminosis D of varying degrees <sup>[8,9]</sup>. Increased urbanization, avoidance of sunlight, clothing practices, and greater atmospheric pollution may aggravate this problem <sup>[10]</sup>. While severe vitamin D deficiency may present with radiological features of rickets/osteomalacia, subclinical vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency may have adverse consequences on the bone because of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Adequate supplementation with vitamin D may increase bone mass and decrease the risk of fractures <sup>[11,12]</sup>.</p><p>The optimal amount of vitamin D required for the treatment of vitamin D has been a matter of debate until the recent publication of Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines (ESCPG) <sup>[13]</sup>. The ESCPG suggests that all adults who are vitamin D deficient be treated with 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 once a week for 8 weeks or its equivalent of6000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 daily to achieve a blood level of 25(OH) D above 30 ng/ml, followed by maintenance therapy of 1500-2000 IU/day. The upper tolerable limit of 10,000 IU/day for children and adults 19 yr and older may be needed to correct vitamin D deficiency. In India, one study used 60,000 IU of Cholecalciferol once a month (2000 IU/day) and later 120,000 IU per month (4000 IU/day) for three months without calcium supplementation <sup>[14]</sup>. This study concluded that monthly administration of 60,000 IU of cholecalciferol in healthy subjects with hypovitaminosis D may be sufficient in summer months, but higher doses are required in winter months to maintain 25(OH) D levels in the normal range. Another study has used 60,000 IU/week along with oral calcium supplementation 1 gram per day which also contains Cholecalciferol 500 IU/day (totaling a dose of Cholecalciferol of 8642 IU/day) for a period of eight weeks <sup>[15]</sup>. Though this study has shown a loading dose of vitamin D raises the 25OH D levels to the normal range, the effect is not sustained over a period of one year <sup>[15]</sup>. The recent clinical practice guidelines by the endocrine society <sup>[13]</sup> give us guidance to treat &ldquo;Vitamin D deficiency&rdquo; and the amount of supplementation dose required to maintain adequate vitamin D levels. We report our experience in a group of subjects with vitamin D deficiency treated based on recent endocrine society guidelines.</p><h3 id=materials-andmethods>Materials and Methods</h3><p>Fifty-two consecutive subjects were recruited for the study.

All subjects have stressed the need for regularity and compliance with supplementation in the study period to achieve normal 25(OH) D levels.</p><h3 id=biochemical-estimations>Biochemical estimations</h3><p>After overnight fast venous blood samples were collected in the fasting state without applying a tourniquet for estimation of baseline biochemical and hormonal parameters; quantitative estimation of serum creatinine, albumin, calcium, phosphorous and alkaline phosphatase was determined by an automated analyzer (Roche cobas c 501), using kits supplied by of Roche cobas. Serum albumin was estimated by BCG green (normal range 3.5 to 5.2 g/dl) (detectable limit: 0.2-6g/dl); serum creatinine by Jaffe, generation 2 (normal 0.5 -1.2 mg/dl),(detectable limit: 0.17 -24.9 mg/dl); serum calcium by O-cresol phthalein complex one,(normal range 8.4 -10.2 mg/dl), (detectable limit: 0.4 to 20 mg/dl); serum phosphorous by UV Molybdate method (normal range 2.7 -4.5 mg/dl; (detectable limit 0.31 to 20 mg/dl), serum alkaline phosphatase by IFCC Gen 2 (normal range Men: 40 -130 IU/L; Women: 35-105 IU/L), (detectable limit: 5-1200 IU/L). Electrochemiluminescence ECLIA estimated Serum Vitamin D3 on Elecsys 2010. The assay employs a polyclonal antibody directed against 25-OH vitamin D3. It is a competitive assay. (Traceability: The method has been standardized against LC-MS-MS) (Detectable range: 4-100 ng/ml). A value of 30 ng/ml is defined as vitamin D sufficiency. A value of &lt; 20 ng/ml is defined as vitamin D deficiency, and values between 20 to 30 ng/ml are defined as vitamin D insufficiency. Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) intact was estimated by electrochemiluminescence ECLIA on Elecsys 2010 Roche cobas kit. (Normal range is 15-65 pg/ml), (detectable range 1.2 to 5000 pg/ml.</p><p>Figure 1:</p><h3 id=statistical-analysis>Statistical analysis</h3><p>Statistical analysis was performed with the statistical software SPSS (Version 11.5). Results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Group means at different intervals of time of supplementation were compared using parametric (paired students t-test) tests. ANOVA, followed by the Bonferroni correction test, was used to compare various indices at three different intervals. With respect to 25 OHD and intact PTH variables, the wide dispersion median and interquartile range (IQR) is calculated. For these two parameters to compare the changes in therapy with different intervals of time, a non-parametric test (Wilcoxon-signed ranks sign test) was used. P value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p><h3 id=results>Results</h3><p>The mean age of the study group was 48 ± 15 years (17 men and 35 women).

The 25 OH D and intact PTH correlated negatively (r = - 0.28; P &lt; 0.05). The 25 OH D levels were elevated three times compared to baseline in the 2nd month and by 50% at the 5th month of supplementation (compared to the 2nd month), which was statistically significant (P&lt;0.001). The intact PTH levels were suppressed by 38% from the baseline in the 2nd month, which was statistically significant P&lt;0.001). With follow-up, there was no significant suppression of PTH levels in the 5th month of supplementation (Figure 3).</p><p>There was no statistically significant difference in other biochemical parameters such as serum albumin, creatinine, calcium, phosphorous and alkaline phosphatase between baselines, 2nd and 5th months of supplementation.</p><h3 id=discussion>Discussion</h3><p>Following the increased awareness of widespread vitamin D deficiency in India <sup>[7]</sup> there has been much debate regarding corrective measures and adequate intake of vitamin D to correct vitamin D deficiency state. In India, apart from vitamin D deficiency, dietary calcium deficiency co-exists. Adequate levels of 25 OH D are required for maximal absorption of calcium from the gut <sup>[3,4]</sup>.</p><p>The present study is based on the current Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline <sup>[13]</sup>. Previous studies from India have used either 3000 or4000 IU/day of Cholecalciferol without calcium supplementation <sup>[14,16]</sup> or 8642 IU/day of Cholecalciferol supplementation along with 1 gm of elemental calcium <sup>[15]</sup>. There is no mention of those who did not respond to therapy and their further follow-up. This study addresses these issues. The present study has emphasized &ldquo;supplementation therapy&rdquo; for achieving vitamin D sufficiency and later &ldquo;maintenance therapy&rdquo; to be followed as a preventive strategy for keeping bone health based on guideline recommendations <sup>[14]</sup>. The present study also addresses the nonresponder&rsquo;s follow-up.</p><p>In the present study, only 23% of subjects attained vitamin D sufficiency at the end of 2 months of supplementation with a threefold rise in serum 25OH D levels. We used 9572 IU/day of Cholecalciferol which is the near-upper tolerable intake level (UL) as per the guidelines <sup>[13]</sup>. In our study, 23% of subjects attained vitamin D sufficiency as compared to 54% of subjects who attained normalcy in other studies from India <sup>[15]</sup>, which used similar dosage schedules. The probable reason could be that the present study was conducted beginning in July, and the supplementation schedule followed through winter till December. In the other study in India <sup>[15]</sup>, the patients were recruited in March and followed through summer till May/June.</p><p>Increased sunlight exposure could be the possible explanation for these differences. This explanation is substantiated by another study from India in the same location <sup>[14]</sup>, which showed 2000 IU/day (50 ug/day) of Cholecalciferol provided different incremental responses in serum 25 OH D levels of a group of patients supplemented in summer and winter. The incremental response of 25 OH D was higher in summer compared to winter <sup>[14]</sup>.</p><p>There is no documented study from this country on the follow-up of subjects who did not respond to initial 2 months of &ldquo;supplementation therapy&rdquo; (on supplementing with Cholecalciferol along with calcium). In the present study, only 23% of subjects attained vitamin D sufficiency at the end of 2 months of supplementation. Of the remaining 77% who did not achieve vitamin D sufficiency, 23% were in the vitamin D insufficiency range and 54 % in the vitamin D deficiency range at the end of 2 months of supplementation. We used half the UL of Cholecalciferol recommended by the guidelines keeping in view the patient shouldn&rsquo;t go into hypercalcemia during 3 months of second supplementation (Figure 2).</p><p>At the end of five months of supplementation, 46% of the recruited subjects (n=52) had achieved vitamin D sufficiency, and 27 % were still in the vitamin D insufficiency range. None of them presented with hypercalcemia despite the dose of Cholecalciferol in the UL of the recommendation, along with elemental calcium supplementation of 1 gm per day. About 27% of subjects were still vitamin D deficient at the end of 5th month of vitamin D supplementation. We postulate that these subjects should be evaluated for malabsorption of the gut. Other studies from India have also shown that only 56% to 47% of their study group had attained a sufficient vitamin D range <sup>[14,15]</sup>. The other group used 25 OH D levels of 20 ng/ml as their normal range and hence could not be compared <sup>[16]</sup>. The intact PTH levels dropped by 38% from the baseline and were stable in the 5th month of therapy (Figure 3).</p><p>The potential implications of vitamin D deficiency in Indians are wide-ranging. Apart from the low bone mass, it might involve an association with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pulmonary tuberculosis. From the results of the present study, the following conclusions can be drawn.</p><ul><li><ol><li>calcium supplementation should form an integral part of therapy for the treatment of hypovitaminosis D,</li></ol></li><li><ol start=2><li>Vitamin D used in the upper ceiling dose of 10,000 IU/day, as recommended by the Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines, does not produce hypercalcemia</li></ol></li></ul><blockquote><p>(despite elemental calcium supplementation of 1g/day) as observed in this study and other studies <sup>[17,18]</sup> also,</p></blockquote><ul><li><ol start=3><li>Evaluation of vitamin D status may be required at the end of 2 months of (Figure 4) supplementation to assess the need for further supplementation or maintenance therapy as a part of the preventive strategy,</li></ol></li><li><ol start=4><li>patients with vitamin D insufficiency at baseline may reach vitamin D sufficiency after 2 months of supplementation, and</li></ol></li><li><ol start=5><li>Patient with severe vitamin D deficiency at baseline (25 OH D &lt;4ng/ml, which is also the lowest detectable limit of the assay</li></ol></li></ul><blockquote><ul><li>hence we may not be aware of the actual deficiency) may require a 2nd supplementation therapy (the dose and duration needs to be ascertained by further studies) (Figure 4).</li></ul></blockquote><p>There are limitations in the study with respect to the number of subjects studied and the duration of the study. In a country like India, financial constraints are to screen, evaluate and follow up (mainly the cost of investigation and medicines). More studies with larger numbers from different parts of India might help arrive at a consensus, especially with respect to the duration of therapy and the need for second supplementation for non-responders. Still, this short duration study of five to six months gives us an idea of supplementations and problems one is likely to face in supplementation of vitamin D in a country like India.</p><p><strong>Acknowledgment</strong></p><p>CVH designed the study, followed up with the patients, did an analysis of data, and was involved in writing the manuscript.
