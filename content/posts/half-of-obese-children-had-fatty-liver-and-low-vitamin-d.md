INTRODUCTION::

The increasing incidence of obesity in children is a significant risk factor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and obesity-associated morbidity. Vitamin D has a major role in bone mineral metabolism and has antimicrobial, antioxidant properties. In this study we aimed to investigate the role of vitamin D in obese children with hepatosteatosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS::

One hundred and one children with obesity were included in this study. Hepatosteatosis was diagnosed and graded using ultrasonography. Serum levels of 25-(OH) vitamin D, calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase and parathormone were tested. Two-sided t-test and Pearson's chi square tests were used for the relationship between vitamin D and hepatosteatosis.

RESULTS::

In our study group, 45.5% were female (n = 46) and the mean age was 11.5 ± 2.8 (range: 3-17 years).  **Hepatosteatosis was identified in 58 children (57.4%).**  Diagnosis of grade 1 and grade 2 hepatosteatosis were made in forty one (40.6%) and seventeen (16.8%) children, respectively. Median serum 25-(OH) vitamin D levels in children without hepatosteatosis was 16.4 ng/mL (interquartile range: 12.4-24.8 ng/mL), whereas children with grade 1 and grade 2 hepatosteatosis had 25-(OH) vitamin D levels of 14.2 ng/mL (interquartile range: 9.5-21.2 ng/mL) and 11.5 ng/mL (interquartile range: 7.5-16.7 ng/mL) respectively (p = 0.005). There was a positive correlation between insulin resistance and the grade of hepatosteatosis (p = 0.03).

CONCLUSIONS::

Serum vitamin D levels in obese children with hepatosteatosis are significantly lower than vitamin D levels in obese children without hepatosteatosis. In this observational study we only refer to the association of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency with hepatosteatosis.
