#### Vitamin D Status in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: Determinants and Effects of the Response to Probiotic Supplementation

Metabolites. 2022 Jul 1;12(7):611. [doi: 10.3390/metabo12070611.](https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo12070611.)

A relationship between the presence of clinical symptoms and gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances associated with nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency, has been observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The aim was to evaluate 25(OH)D levels according to the annual rhythm cycle, gender, the severity of autism, nutritional or clinical status, inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers, GI symptoms, and the clinical response to probiotic/placebo supplementation in preschooler children with ASD. Eighty-one ASD preschoolers (67 males) were assessed with standardized tools for ASD severity (ADOS score) and GI symptoms (by GI-Index at six-items and at nine-items, the latter defined as the Total GI-Index). The 25(OH)D levels were compared among different ASD subgroups according to metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers (leptin, insulin, resistin, PAI-1, MCP-1, TNF-alfa, and IL-6), gender, and the presence or absence of: 

* (i) GI symptoms, 

* (ii) the response to probiotic supplementation (the improvement of GI symptomatology), 

* (iii) the response to probiotic supplementation (improvement of ASD severity).

Only 25% of the ASD children presented an adequate 25(OH)D status (â‰¥30 ng/mL according to the Endocrine Society guidelines). All the 25(OH)D levels falling in the severe deficiency range (&lt;10 ng/mL) were observed in the male subgroup. A significant inverse correlation between 25(OH)D and leptin was observed (R = -0.24, p = 0.037). 

 **An inverse correlation was found between 25(OH)D levels and the GI Index**  6-Items and Total GI-Index (R = -0.25, p = 0.026; -0.27, = 0.009) and a direct relationship with the probiotic response (R = 0.4, p = 0.05). 

The monitoring of 25(OH)D levels and the co-administration of 25(OH)D and probiotic supplementation could be considered in ASD from early ages.
