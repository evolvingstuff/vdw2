**HOW TO FIGHT CORONAVIRUS WITH VITAMIN D** 

Vitamin D has been scientifically proven to successfully prevent and/or treat many viruses, including 5 coronaviruses similar to COVID-19. 

 **Take a single dose of at least 50,000 IU of Vitamin D weekly for prevention during the time of the threat,   
 &nbsp; &nbsp; and an additional 50,000 IU immediately upon experiencing symptoms.** 

All statements about Vitamin D below are backed by scientific studies, most of which are randomized control trials.

 **ABOUT THE AUTHOR** 

Henry Lahore, a retired Boeing engineer, founded  [VitaminDWiki](https://VitaminDWiki.com/VitaminDWiki) in 2010 - it now has 10,000+ Vitamin D studies, which can be read and searched in 108+ languages. The [COVID-19 page on VitaminDWiki](/posts/covid-19-coronavirus-can-most-likely-be-fought-by-vitamin-d) has news, maps, studies, reasons why Vitamin D will help, etc.

Henry co-authored a paper March 5 on [Coronavirus and Vitamin D](/posts/vitamin-d-supplementation-could-prevent-and-treat-influenza-coronavirus-and-pneumonia-infections).

Henry has been asked to advise on a  study concerning the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 with megadoses of Vitamin D in China.

 **VITAMIN D PREVENTS AND TREATS VIRUSES LIKE COVID-19** 

Active Vitamin D in the body acts like a hormone that is used by <a href="/posts/every-single-cell" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 9538">every single cell</a>.

Vitamin D is especially good at fortifying the [immune system](/categories/immunity) - in fact, it is a vital part of our normal defense against [disease](/posts/health-problems-and-vitamin-d-association-prevention-and-treatment).

Vitamin D has been proven by randomized controlled trials to prevent/treat <a href="/posts/at-least-30-diseases-including-viral-infections" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 5217">at least 30 diseases, including viral infections.</a>.

Vitamin D can prevent or treat the [common cold and Influenza](/posts/overview-colds-and-flu-and-vitamin-d), and  [5 coronaviruses](/posts/four-of-the-7-types-of-human-coronavirus-only-cause-mild-respiratory-infections). For example, there is a <a href="/posts/7x-less-risk-of-influenza-if-vitamin-d-levels-higher-than-30-ng-no-shot-needed" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: 7X less risk of influenza if Vitamin D levels higher than 30 ng (no shot needed) â€“ Oct 2017">7X</a> less risk of influenza for people who have tested blood levels of Vitamin D higher than 30 ng/ml.

It is too soon for study results for [Vitamin D and COVID-19](https://VitaminDWiki.com/COVID-19+Coronavirus+can+most+likely+be+fought+by+Vitamin+D#Clinical_trials_for_COVID-19_in_CHINA_as_of_Feb_26_-_including_one_monitoring_outcome_vs_Vitamin_D), but it is reasonable to expect that Vitamin D will have a similar impact on it as on [other coronaviruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus#Human_coronaviruses).

Vitamin D is produced in the skin by exposure to the sun; people who spend a lot of time outdoors have greater immunity. For example, in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, patients were [3 times less likely to die if they had daily exposure to the sun](https://medium.com/@ra.hobday/coronavirus-and-the-sun-a-lesson-from-the-1918-influenza-pandemic-509151dc8065) (Lancet).

 **GETTING ENOUGH VITAMIN D TO FIGHT COVID-19** 

Vitamin D can, of course, be taken as a supplement. 

Vitamin D is the only supplement that can quickly fight coronaviruses. 

Unlike most supplements, Vitamin D acts quickly in the body. For example, a single 50,000 IU dose of Vitamin D  can prevent the flu for a week, and even [stop the flu in 3 days](/posts/influenza-prevented-by-40-ng-levels-or-treated-with-vitamin-d-hammer-50000-iu).

One 50,000 IU dose, the same amount of Vitamin D as you would get on a 4-5 day[sunny vacation](/categories/noontime-sun-and-d), should be enough to prevent or stop COVID-19 in a healthy Caucasian adult of normal weight. 

People who are [Obese](/posts/overview-obesity-and-vitamin-d), [seniors](/posts/13-reasons-why-many-seniors-need-more-vitamin-d-both-dose-and-level), having [dark skins](/posts/overview-dark-skin-and-vitamin-d) or compromised immune systems need to take at least twice a much Vitamin D.

Children need smaller doses - proportional to the weight of 180 lb adult. For example: a 90 lb child would get 1/2 as much.

Vitamin D is not only safe to take while [pregnant](/posts/overview-pregnancy-and-vitamin-d), but is actually extremely beneficial for the mom and her baby.

 **WHY YOU NEED TO TAKE A SINGLE WEEKLY DOSE** 

 **You should take 50,000 IU weekly during the pandemic.** 

 **If you should experience flu, colds or COVID-19 symptoms, immediately take 50,000 IU.**  Don't wait for COVID-19 test results.

Weekly dosing of 50,000 IU will get the Vitamin D levels to  [> 40 ng on a weekly basis](https://VitaminDWiki.com/Take+vitamin+D3+daily+or+weekly#Response_to_a_single_dose_of_100_000_IU_of_vitamin_D) - enough to fight a virus and eliminate the symptoms in 3 days.

A single high dose pushes Vitamin D levels over 40 ng for only a few days - during which time the immune system is fortified.

But daily dosing (say, of 4,000 IU) will not result in > 40 ng level before 3-4 months.

 **TAKING YOUR VITAMIN D SAFELY** 

[Even much larger doses than 50,000 IU have been proven both safe and effective for most people](/posts/overview-loading-of-vitamin-d). In fact, Henry will be involved in a study using a single dose of 600,000 IU. 

Vitamin D increases the effectiveness of most drugs. This is not a problem for most [prescribed and over-the-counter drugs](/posts/some-people-have-problems-with-vitamin-d), but you do not want to take a 50,000 IU dose if, say, you are on [chemotherapy](/posts/chemotherapy-and-vitamin-d-many-studies). If Chemo is not reduced it could be fatal.

By the way, If you have not already gotten a flu shot, don't do it now, whether or not you are taking Vitamin D, because the current flu vaccine increases your chance of getting a coronavirus, such as COVID-19, by 36% ( [Lancet](https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/prestigious-vaccine-journal-flu-vaccine-increases-coronavirus-infection-risk-36-3?utm_campaign=Daily%20Newsletter%3A%20Prestigious%20VACCINE%20Journal%3A%20Flu%20Vaccine%20Increases%20Coronavirus%20Infection%20Risk%2036%25%20%28PdsuqS%29&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Daily%20Newsletter&_ke=eyJrbF9lbWFpbCI6ICJobGFob3JlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSIsICJrbF9jb21wYW55X2lkIjogIksydlhBeSJ9)).

You may want to adjust two[nutrients](/posts/vitamin-d-cofactors-in-a-nutshell) when taking a lot of Vitamin D:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1) Get at least 100 mg of [magnesium](/posts/overview-magnesium-and-vitamin-d) daily to prevent itchy skin - about 3 in 1,000 people get itchy skin when taking Vitamin D. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2) Reduce the amount of  [calcium](/posts/calcium-and-vitamin-d) - Vitamin D increases the calcium uptake by the gut.

Note: Large doses of Vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia after many months if standard inorganic calcium supplements such as calcium carbonate are taken, but [plant-based calciums](/posts/calcium-hazards-and-bioavailability) such as Red Mineral Algae can be safely taken with Vitamin D.

 **VIDEOS** 

VitaminDWiki has produced a 5-minute video: [Does Less Sun mean More Disease](/posts/does-less-sun-mean-more-disease) which is available in multiple languages.

Two YouTube videos were made in March 2020 on the benefits of Vitamin D for COVID-19:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Vitamin D and immunity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5yVGmfivAk) Dr. Campbell 750,000 Views as of March 20

 **OTHER INFORMATION** 

It is best to take Vitamin D with [dinner](/posts/take-vitamin-d-with-or-before-evening-meal) - about 50% more vitamin D gets into the blood when it stays in the small intestine for a long time before the next meal.

To get even better prevention and treatment from Vitamin D you can increase the initial dose size - up to 600,000 IU (with perhaps 5 times benefit), then continue with weekly 50,000 IU doses.

30% of people will greatly increase Vitamin D getting to their cells by taking [receptor activators](/categories/vitamin-d-receptor), such as [Resveratrol](/posts/resveratrol-improves-health-vitamin-d-receptor-etc-many-studies) or [Quercetin](/posts/quercetin-a-flavonoid-helps-activate-the-vitamin-d-receptor-many-studies).

[People with poor Vitamin D receptors have a 50% higher risk of virus infection](/posts/risk-of-enveloped-virus-infection-is-increased-50-percent-if-poor-vitamin-d-receptor-meta-analysis).

[While Vitamin C helps in many ways](/posts/vitamin-c-is-important-for-the-common-cold-and-much-else), it does not prevent and doesn't appear to [treat COVID-19](http://orthomolecular.activehosted.com/index.php?action=social&chash=0a09c8844ba8f0936c20bd791130d6b6.148&s=1a86af640e6320f7168d4d11d13a55c1).

[Pneumonia Risk, intensity, and mortality are all associated with low vitamin D](/posts/pneumonia-and-low-vitamin-d-many-studies).

[There are different forms of vitamin D available](/posts/getting-vitamin-d-into-your-blood-and-cells) for people with a poor gut, poor liver, or are vegan, can't swallow capsules, etc.

[The Coronavirus Is Not Causing Deaths- - Weak Immune Systems Are](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2020/03/bill-sardi/the-coronavirus-is-not-causing-deaths-weak-immune-systems-are/) Sardi March 20

&nbsp; &nbsp;He recommends 50,000 IU of vitamin D once a day  for 3-5 days followed by 8,000 IU daily

A single bottle of vitamin D  should help many people (family and friends) fight coronavirus, influenza for many months.

 **ADDITIONAL THINGS KNOWN TO FIGHT VIRUS** 

Spend time outdoors in fresh air and sunshine, especially when you can generate vitamin D and also kill virus (when your shadow is shorter than you are).

Buy home UVC air purifiers - for 5 years I have used [Germ Guardians - $43 each - virtually silent.](https://www.amazon.com/GermGuardian-GG1000-Pluggable-Deodorizer-Guardian/dp/B000G2BESO/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2LDI2UJHL1631&dchild=1&keywords=germ+guardian+air+purifier&qid=1584900079&sprefix=germ+gu%2Caps%2C326&sr=8-4&swrs=70CCD078252FFE1646529BBD6B6CC3B8)

 **HOW TO GET VITAMIN D** 

Your local grocery store, pharmacy, Wal-Mart, etc. will typically sell bottles with 2,000-10,000 IU capsules

Amazon (US) has >700 suppliers of bottles wtih 5,000 IU capsules

Amazon (US) has >7 suppliers of bottles with 50,000 IU capsules

I prefer the [Bio-Tech Pharmacal brand with 50,000 capsules](https://www.amazon.com/s?i=aps&k=bio-tech%20vitamin%2050%2C000&ref=nb_sb_noss&url=search-alias%3Daps)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [GreenVits](https://www.greenvits.eu/collections/vitamin-d) - in the UK has a limited supply of sample bottles of 4,000 IU capsules of Vitamin D3, ~0163~ 6 covers shipping and handling. contact  rufus@greenvits.eu
