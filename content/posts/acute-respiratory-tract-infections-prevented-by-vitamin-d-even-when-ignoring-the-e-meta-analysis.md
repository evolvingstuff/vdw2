#### Review of the above study: Vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory tract infections - July 2017

Vitamin D deficiency, and the role of vitamin D supplementation, is controversial. However, it is hard to ignore the recent systematic review suggesting that, at last, we may have a magic bullet for reducing the rate of respiratory tract infections in children.<sup>[1]</sup> This systematic review was unusual in that the authors obtained the individual data from all  **10 933 participants in the 25 randomised trials**  included in their review. Such non-aggregated data enable a far more reliable assessment of response in pre-specified subgroups. The quality of the evidence was rated as high, and the overall result was protective, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81, 0.96; P = 0.001; number needed to treat (NNT) = 33 (to prevent one respiratory tract infection).

* Twelve randomised controlled trials were in children <16 years;

* four in infants <1 year (n = 5571) and 

* eight in 1.1–15.9 years (n = 1079). 

No significant benefit was seen in infants; adjusted OR = 0.94 (95% CI 0.83, 1.06; P = 0.33). 

However, in the  **1.1–15.9 year**  age group, the  **adjusted OR was 0.60**  (95% CI 0.46, 0.77; P < 0.001), with an  **NNT of 8** . Subgroup analysis found, unsurprisingly, a better response in those with low baseline vitamin D levels (i.e. 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 25 nmol/L). Surprisingly, daily or weekly supplementation was more effective than bolus injections. Influenza vaccine status had no significant effect on response. The generalisability of these findings is unclear.
