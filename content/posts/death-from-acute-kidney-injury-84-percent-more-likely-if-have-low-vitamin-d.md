OBJECTIVE: Numerous studies have evaluated the prevalence and importance of vitamin D deficiency among patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease, however, little is known about vitamin D levels in acute kidney injury (AKI). We evaluated the association between vitamin D metabolites and clinical outcomes among patients with AKI.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.

PATIENTS: 30 participants with AKI and 30 controls from general hospital wards and intensive care units at a tertiary care hospital.

MEASUREMENTS: Plasma levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D <span>[1,25(OH)(2) D]</span>, 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) , vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) were measured within 24 hours of AKI onset and 5 days later. Bioavailable 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)(2) D levels, defined as the sum of free- and albumin-bound 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)(2) D, were estimated using equations.

RESULTS: Compared to controls, participants with AKI had lower levels of 1,25(OH)(2) D [17 (10-22) versus 25 (15-35) pg/ml, p=0.01](17%20(10-22)%20versus%2025%20(15-35)%20pg/ml,%20p=0.01), lower levels of VDBP [23 (15-31) versus 29 (25-36) mg/dl, p=0.003](23%20(15-31)%20versus%2029%20(25-36)%20mg/dl,%20p=0.003), and similar levels of bioavailable 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)(2) D at enrollment. Levels of bioavailable 25(OH)D were inversely associated with severity of sepsis in the overall sample (p<0.001). Among participants with AKI, bioavailable 25(OH)D, but not other vitamin D metabolites, was significantly associated with mortality after adjusting for age and serum creatinine (adjusted odds ratio per 1 SD ln <span>[bioavailable 25(OH)D]</span> =  **0.16** , 95% confidence interval=0.03 to 0.85).

CONCLUSIONS: Bioavailable 25(OH)D could have a role as a biomarker or mediator of adverse outcomes among patients with established AKI. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.
