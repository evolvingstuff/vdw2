Objectives Vitamin D is important in normal brain development. In animals low vitamin D level is associated with brain morphological alterations including enlargement of the brain. Whether a similar association exists in humans is unknown. Here we investigated the relationship between vitamin D and total intracranial volume as well as total volume of the cortical grey and cerebral white matter and that of the ventricles in young healthy women. 

Methods To assess volumes we applied semi-automatic user-independent MR volumetry. 

For the vitamin D measurements automated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay was used. 

Results We found a significant negative correlation between vitamin D and 

* total intracranial volume as well as 

* total cortical grey and cerebral white matter volumes. 

Discussion This association may reflect a trait-like relationship between vitamin D and brain size possibly determined in early development.

Not enough information in the abstract to understand what exactly was being measures, on how many people, and how big the effect was:(1%, 10%, or what)
