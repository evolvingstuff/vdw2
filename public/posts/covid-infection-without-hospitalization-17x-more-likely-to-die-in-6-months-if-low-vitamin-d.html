#### Association between vitamin D deficiency and post-acute outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection

Eur J Nutr. 2024 Mar;63(2):613-622. [doi: 10.1007/s00394-023-03298-3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-023-03298-3) PDF can be rented at DeepDyve

Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the association between vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and post-acute outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

Methods: This retrospective study used the TriNetX research network to identify COVID-19 patients between January 1 and November 30, 2022. Patients were matched using propensity score matching (PSM) and divided into  **VDD (&lt; 20 ng/mL)**  and control (≥ 20 ng/mL) groups. The primary outcome was a composite of post-COVID-19 condition (identified by ICD-10 code), all-cause emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization, and death during the follow-up period (90-180 days) after the diagnosis of COVID-19.

Results: From an initial recruitment of 42,674 non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and known 25(OH)D status, a VDD group of 8300 was identified and propensity matched with 8300 controls. During the follow-up period, the VDD group had a higher risk of the primary outcome than did the control group &lt;span&gt;[hazard ratio (HR) = 1.122; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.041-1.210]&lt;/span&gt;. 

The VDD group also had a 

* higher risk of all-cause ED visits (HR = 1.114; 95% CI = 1.012-1.226),

* all-cause hospitalization (HR = 1.230; 95% CI = 1.105-1.369), and 

* all-cause death (HR = 1.748; 95% CI = 1.047-2.290) 

but not post-COVID-19 condition (HR = 0.980; 95% CI = 0.630-1.523), individually.

Conclusion: Among the COVID-19 patients, VDD might be associated with a higher risk of all-cause ED visits, hospitalization, and death during the post-acute phase.

#### Note: COVID also reduces Vitamin D Receptor activation, which results in less D getting to cells

Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the association between vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and post-acute outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

Methods: This retrospective study used the TriNetX research network to identify COVID-19 patients between January 1 and November 30, 2022. Patients were matched using propensity score matching (PSM) and divided into __VDD (&lt; 20 ng/mL)__ and control (≥ 20 ng/mL) groups. The primary outcome was a composite of post-COVID-19 condition (identified by ICD-10 code), all-cause emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization, and death during the follow-up period (90-180 days) after the diagnosis of COVID-19.

Results: From an initial recruitment of 42,674 non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and known 25(OH)D status, a VDD group of 8300 was identified and propensity matched with 8300 controls. During the follow-up period, the VDD group had a higher risk of the primary outcome than did the control group [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.122; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.041-1.210]. 
The VDD group also had a 
*higher risk of all-cause ED visits (HR = 1.114; 95% CI = 1.012-1.226),
*all-cause hospitalization (HR = 1.230; 95% CI = 1.105-1.369), and 
*all-cause death (HR = 1.748; 95% CI = 1.047-2.290) 
but not post-COVID-19 condition (HR = 0.980; 95% CI = 0.630-1.523), individually.

Conclusion: Among the COVID-19 patients, VDD might be associated with a higher risk of all-cause ED visits, hospitalization, and death during the post-acute phase.
