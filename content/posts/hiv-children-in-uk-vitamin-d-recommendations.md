#### VitaminDWiki Recommendations

Do not wait until Autumn and a vitamin D test

In fact, not vitamin D test is rarely needed.

Virtually every HIV person is low on vitamin D

Use a restoring  dose of a total of about 300,000 IU over 1 month

Followed by a maintenace  dose of ab least 2,000 IU daily (average)
