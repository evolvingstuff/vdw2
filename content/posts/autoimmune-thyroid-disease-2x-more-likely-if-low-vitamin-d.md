Backgroud: Low serum vitamin D level has been associated with several autoimmune diseases, but its association with thyroid autoimmunity is unclear. We evaluated the association of serum vitamin D level with the prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). 

Methods: Our cross-sectional study included subjects who underwent routine health check-ups, which included assays of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab), as well as thyroid ultrasonography (US) between 2008 and 2012 at Asan Medical Center. We defined AITD according to the level of TPO-Ab and US findings. 

Results: Total 6,685 subjects (Male, 58%; Female, 42%) were enrolled for this study. Overall prevalence of TPO-Ab positivity and both TPO-Ab/US positivity were 10.1% (Male, 6.3%; Female, 15.3%) and 5.4% (Male, 2.3%; Female, 9.7%), respectively. In female subjects, mean serum 25(OH)D3 levels were significantly lower in TPO-Ab(+) (22.0 vs. 23.5 ng/mL, P=0.030), and TPO-Ab(+)/US(+) group (21.6 vs. 23.4 ng/mL, P=0.027) as compared with corresponding control group, respectively. According to the level of serum 25(OH)D3, the prevalence of TPO-Ab positivity (21.2%, 15.5% and 12.6% in deficient, insufficient, and sufficient group, respectively, P=0.001) and both TPO-Ab/US positivity (14.7%, 9.9% and 7.1% in deficient, insufficient, and sufficient group, respectively, P<0.001) was decreased in female subjects. Interestingly, this pattern was significant only in pre-menopausal women (P=0.003 and P<0.001, respectively), but not in post-menopausal women. 

Multivariate analysis indicated that the adjusted odds ratios (OR) for AITD among those in the 25(OH)D3-deficient (TPO-Ab(+); OR=1.95, P=0.001 and TPO-Ab(+)/US(+); OR=2.36, P<0.001), and -insufficient group (TPO-Ab(+); OR=1.31, P=0.043 and TPO-Ab(+)/US(+); OR=1.50, P=0.017) were significantly increased when compared with -sufficient group. 

Conclusions: The level of serum vitamin D was significantly lower in pre-menopausal women with AITD. 

Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were significantly associated with AITD in pre-menopausal women.
