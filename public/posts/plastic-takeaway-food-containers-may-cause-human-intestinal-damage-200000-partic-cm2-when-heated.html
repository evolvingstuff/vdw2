The microplastics and organic additives formed in routine use of plastic takeaway food containers may pose significant health risks. Thus, we collected plastic containers made of 

* polystyrene, 

* polypropylene, 

* polyethylene terephthalate, 

* olylactic acid and simulated two thermal usages, including hot water (I) and microwave treatments (M).

Nile Red fluorescence staining was developed to improve accurate counting of microplastics with the aid of TEM and DLS analysis. The quantity of MPs released from thermal treatments was determined ranging from 285.7 thousand items/cm2 to 681.5 thousand items/cm2 in containers loaded with hot water  **with the following order: IPS&gt;IPP&gt;IPET&gt;IPLA,**  while microwave treatment showed lower values ranging from 171.9 thousand items/cm2 to 301.6 thousand items/cm2. In vitro toxicity test using human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells indicated  **decrease of cell viability**  in raw leachate, resuspended MPs and supernatants, which might further lead to cell membrane rupture, ROS production, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, the leachate inhibited the expression of key genes in the electron transport chain (ETC) process, disrupted energy metabolism. For the first time, we isolate the actually released microplastics and organic substances for in vitro toxicity testing, and demonstrate their potential impacts to human intestine.

Environmental Implication

As a new type of contaminants, microplastics are becoming a great concern in environment. However, microplastics released from plastic food containers and its impact on human health is not clearly understood. This study investigated the formation and characteristics of microplastics from different types of plastic takeaway food containers after loading hot food and microwave heating. Microplastics and dissolved contaminants were separated and their respective toxic effects on Caco-2 cells were examined. Our research highlights new route of environmental risk of microplastics, and is useful for environmental management on plastic takeaway containers that may have been ignored before.

Synopsis

Plastic take-out containers may release microplastics and organic substances during daily usage, both of which can cause individual and combined cytotoxic effects on human colon adenocarcinoma cells Caco-2.
