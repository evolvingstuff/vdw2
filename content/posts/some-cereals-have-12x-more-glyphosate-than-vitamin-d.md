"...EWG has released the results of laboratory tests that found glyphosate widespread in oat-based breakfast cereals and snack bars popular with kids. The vast majority of the non-organic products analyzed – **85 percent**  – had levels of the weed killer above [EWG’s health benchmark of 160 parts per billion](https://www.ewg.org/news-and-analysis/2018/08/how-does-ewg-set-health-benchmark-glyphosate-exposure), or ppb."

 **Thus 85% of oat cereals and snack bars had > 0.160 ppm Glyphosate**

* "Oats Would Have Virtually No Glyphosate Residues if Farmers Quit Using the Chemical as a Preharvest Drying Agent"

* "U.S. Department of Agriculture testing done in 2011 revealed glyphosate in all soybean samples tested."

* "Limited testing for glyphosate done by the FDA in 2016 found glyphosate in virtually all foods tested, including wheat crackers, granola cereal, corn meal, oatmeal products and honey"

* "Glyphosate has also been found in many wines, including organic ones."
