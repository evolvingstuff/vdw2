The healthier an immune system is, the better it is able to fight off attacks.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; both prevention and treatment

There are many ways to fortify the immune system in 2 to 3 months.

A few of the ways provide both prevention and treatment

A megadose of Vitamin D appears to be the only way to provide both prevention and treatment in days

I would like to test two COVID-19 hypotheses and use any positive results this October.

1) A single megadose of Vitamin D can prevent Coronavirus infection

(Would require RCT of people who are at very high risk of becoming infected)

2) A single megadose of Vitamin D will treat COVID-19 patients, reducing one or more of: duration, severity, death

(RCT could be done in a hospital and/or home environment)

The Chinese have an [on-going clinical trial](https://VitaminDWiki.com/COVID-19+Coronavirus+can+most+likely+be+fought+by+Vitamin+D#Clinical_trials_for_COVID-19_in_CHINA_as_of_Feb_26_-_including_one_monitoring_outcome_vs_Vitamin_D) to measure Vitamin D levels of COVID-19 patients

The clinical trial anticipates that higher Vitamin D levels will be found to be associated with better outcomes.
