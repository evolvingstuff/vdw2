#### Review found association, but no consensus by the Randomized Controlled trials - Nov 2018

 **Vitamin D and Cardiorespiratory Fitness in the General Population: A Systematic Review.** 

Int J Vitam Nutr Res. 2018 Nov 30:1-12. [doi: 10.1024/0300-9831/a000490.](https://doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831/a000490.)

BACKGROUND: Up to now, the association between vitamin D and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is still inconsistent and there is a lack of a comprehensive review on this topic.

AIM: To systematically review the literature including both observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the association between vitamin D and CRF in the general population.

METHODS: The literature was investigated by exploring databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and ISI Web of Science as well as a manual search up to April 2017 by using related MeSH terms and key words. All the English-language articles that were conducted in the general population without any restriction on age range of participants and date of publication were included in the study.

RESULTS:

Among the 731 records which were found initially, a total of 20 articles including 18 cross-sectional studies and 2 RCTs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Among the cross-sectional studies, findings on the association between serum 25(OH) D and CRF were incongruent.  **Additionally, studies which had reported significant results varied remarkably in terms of sample size, study population and the effect size of the association** . In addition, RCTs found no significant improvement in CRF following vitamin D supplementation.

CONCLUSION:

Overall, evidence from cross-sectional studies does not support a strong association between vitamin D and CRF,  **although a number of studies demonstrated modest positive associations** . Furthermore, limited RCTs did not confirm such an association. Further high quality research is needed to obtain a definite conclusion on this topic.
