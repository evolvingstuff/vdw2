OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects on parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) of two dosing regimens of cholecalciferol in women with secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPTH) and hypovitaminosis D and to investigate variables affecting 25(OH)D response to cholecalciferol. 

DESIGN: Randomized-controlled trial with 6-month follow-up. 

SETTING: Two osteoporosis centers in northern Italy. 

PARTICIPANTS: Sixty community-dwelling women aged 65 and older with sHPTH and hypovitaminosis D, creatinine clearance greater than 65 mL/min and without diseases or drugs known to influence bone and vitamin D metabolism. 

INTERVENTION: Cholecalciferol 300,000 IU every 3 months, once at baseline and once at 3 months (intermittent D(3) group)  **or cholecalciferol 1,000 IU/day (daily D(3)**  group). MEASUREMENTS: Serum PTH, 25(OH)D, calcium, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, beta-C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, phosphate, 24-hour urinary calcium excretion. 

RESULTS: The two groups had similar baseline characteristics. All participants had vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D<20 ng/mL)](25(OH)D<20%20ng/mL)), and 36 subjects (60%) had severe deficiency (<10 ng/mL), with no difference between the groups (severe deficiency: intermittent D(3) group, n=18; daily D(3) group, n=18). After 3 and 6 months, both groups had a significant increase in 25(OH)D and a reduction in PTH. 

Mean absolute increase+/-standard deviation of 25(OH)D at 6 months was higher in the intermittent D(3) group (22.7+/-11.8 ng/mL) than in the daily D(3) group (13.7+/-6.7 ng/mL, P<.001), with a higher proportion of participants in the intermittent D(3) group reaching desirable serum concentration of 25(OH)D >/= 30 ng/mL (55% in the intermittent D(3) group vs 20% in the daily D(3) group, P<.001). 

Mean percentage decrease of PTH in the two groups was comparable, and at 6 months, a similar proportion of participants reached normal PTH values. 25(OH)D response to cholecalciferol showed a wide variability. 

In a logistic regression analysis, body mass index and type of treatment appeared to be significantly associated with normalization of 25(OH)D values. 

CONCLUSION: Cholecalciferol 300,000 IU every 3 months was more effective than 1,000 IU daily in correcting vitamin D deficiency, although the two groups achieved similar effects on PTH at 6 months. Only 55% of the higher-dose intermittent group reached desirable concentrations of 25(OH)D,  **suggesting that yet-higher doses will be required for adequate vitamin D repletion** . PMID: 20646099

Note: 300,000 IU over 3 months = 3300 IU per day - nope, not enough
