### Ignored

3X less Vitamin D from the sun if dark skin genes(250 IU)

4X variation between individuals from the same amount of sun (500- 2000 IU)

4X difference in the amount of skin exposed to the sun (500- 2000 IU)

2X? less burn if start with a good level of vitamin D

4X more vitamin D if wear a UV transparent shirt

### Incorrect

3X less Vitamin D from the sun if elderly (250 IU)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  text claimed 2X more time for elderly, but chart appears to say less time

4X more vitamin D is actually needed (4,000 IU)

 **Yes, too much sun can result in sunburn, especially if you have a low level of vitamin D** 

* [Increase your vitamin D from the sun by wearing a tan-through instead of standard shirt](/posts/increase-your-vitamin-d-from-the-sun-by-wearing-a-tan-through-instead-of-standard-shirt)

   * allows getting more vitamin D per minute by getting UV to more skin at the same time

 **Note: This seems to indicate that seniors need far less time in the sun to get 1,000 IU that younger adults,  
 but their study and others say the opposite**

Although overexposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is responsible for cutaneous melanoma and epithelial skin cancer and can cause negative health effects such as sunburn, a “little and often” exposure regime is often suggested to produce naturally recommended vitamin D levels, being essential for skeletal health. This study aimed to quantify solar UV doses needed to trigger 1000 International Units (IU) vitamin D doses and, at the same time, producing sunburn in Switzerland. Solar UV erythema irradiance (in mW/m2) measured at four meteorological stations in Switzerland for the period 2005–2017 were used to evaluate effective solar UV radiation producing 1000 IU vitamin D doses in skin phototype II and III individuals. Daily solar UV exposure durations (in minutes) needed to produce vitamin D with limited sunburn risk were estimated while considering mean vitamin D food intake of the Swiss population and seasonal skin coverage. In summer and spring, with 22% of uncovered skin, 1000 IU vitamin D doses are synthesized in 10–15 min of sun exposure for adults. Exposure durations between erythema risk and 1000 IU vitamin D production vary between 9 and 46 min. In winter and autumn, the recommended vitamin D production without sunburn risks often unachievable, since up to 6.5 h of sun exposure might be necessary considering 8–10% of uncovered skin surface. The vitamin D food intake only represented 10% of the recommended vitamin D production and remained unchanged throughout the year. These findings might clarify why vitamin D deficiency is common in Switzerland. Moreover, exposure durations between recommended vitamin D and increased sunburn risk might only differ by few minutes. Without additional oral vitamin D supplementation, daily doses of vitamin D (1000 IU) are not reachable in autumn and winter months in Switzerland.
