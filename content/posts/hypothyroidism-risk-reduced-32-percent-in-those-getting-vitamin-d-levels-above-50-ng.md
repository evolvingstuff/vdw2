##### Reduction in Thyroid Symptoms in 3367 people achieving <span style="color:#00F;">>50 ng</span> level of Vitamin D

##### Even more reduction in people achieving <span style="color:#00F;">>80 ng</span>

Purpose: Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroid disease. Our aim was to investigate the influence of vitamin D supplementation on thyroid function and anti-thyroid antibody levels.

Methods: We constructed a database that included 11,017 participants in a health and wellness program that provided vitamin D supplementation to target physiological serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations (>100 nmol/L). Participant measures were compared between entry to the program (baseline) and follow-up (12 ± 3 months later) using an intent-to-treat analysis. Further, a nested case-control design was utilized to examine differences in thyroid function over 1 year in hypothyroid individuals and euthyroid controls.

Results: More than 72% of participants achieved serum 25(OH)D concentrations  **>100 nmol/L**  at follow-up, with 20% above 125 nmol/L. 

Hypothyroidism was detected in 

* 2% (23% including subclinical hypothyroidism) of participants at baseline and 

* 0.4% (or 6% with subclinical) at follow-up. 

Serum 25(OH)D concentrations  **≥125 nmol/L**  were associated with a 

* 30% reduced risk of hypothyroidism and a 

* 32% reduced risk of elevated anti-thyroid antibodies. 

Hypothyroid cases were found to have higher mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations at follow-up, which was a significant positive predictor of improved thyroid function.

Conclusion: The results of the current study suggest that optimal thyroid function might require serum 25(OH)D concentrations above 125 nmol/L. Vitamin D supplementation may offer a safe and economical approach to improve thyroid function and may provide protection from developing thyroid disease

* 11,000 Canadians, Mean age was 48

* "In Canada, one in ten suffer from a thyroid disorder, half of them undiagnosed”

* “The present analysis utilized a large database of participants in a wellness program receiving vitamin D supplementation, with average doses of 6000 IU/d” (for 1 year)

* “Approximately 2% of participants in this health and wellness program were found to be hypothyroid at program entry, with an additional 22% classified as subclinical hypothyroid.”

* “ . . 15.8% of participants that reported thyroid medication use”

* “ . . hypothyroid individuals were three times more likely (27%) and subclinical hypothyroidism nearly twice as likely (17%) to be vitamin D-deficient than euthyroid individuals (10%)”

* “Most intriguing was the finding that **subclinical hypothyroidism was reduced by 72% at follow-up** .”
