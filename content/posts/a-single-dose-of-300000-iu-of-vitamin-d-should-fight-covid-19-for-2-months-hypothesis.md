* Appears that a bolus of 300,000 IU of vitamin D is a standard of practice for many health problems in this hospital in China

* No Vitamin D test is needed before taking the 300,000 IU

---

* Paper says that the bolus dose should last for 2 or 3 months

   * but it appears that vitamin D levels would drop too low to fight COVID-19 after 2 months

* It might be preferable to have a "booster" of 100,000 IU monthly 

   * instead of 300,000 every 2 months

* For prevention, some doctors prefer 50,000 IU daily for a week, followed by 50,000 IU weekly

* Probably need to increase the initial and maintenance doses be 2X larger for those who are[obese](/posts/obese-need-2x-to-3x-more-vitamin-d)

* Approximately 1 in 300 people will get an adverse reaction (itchy skin) to Vitamin D due to a lack of Magnesium

   * Should consider taking 400 mg of [Magnesium](/posts/overview-magnesium-and-vitamin-d) concurrently with the Vitamin D

* To quickly fight a COVID-19 infection a different form of VItamin D should be considered

   * Response of bolus Vitamin D typically start in 12 hours

   * Response to sublingual [Nanoemulsion Vitamin D](/posts/nanoemulsion-vitamin-d-may-be-a-substantially-better-form) appears to start in 3 hours

      * Note: The response to a [Vitamin D injection](/tags/vitamin-d-injection.html) takes several days
