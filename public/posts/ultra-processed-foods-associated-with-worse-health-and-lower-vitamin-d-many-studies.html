Ultraprocessed foods - Asked Perplexity AI Aug 2024</h4><p>Based on the search results, there is strong evidence that high consumption of ultra-processed foods is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes:</p><p><strong>Increased Risk of Mortality</strong></p><ul><li><p>21% greater risk of death from any cause</p></li><li><p>50% increased risk of cardiovascular disease-related death</p></li><li><p>40-66% higher risk of heart disease-related death</p></li></ul><p><strong>Cardiometabolic Health Issues</strong></p><ul><li><p>12% greater risk of type 2

parameters they examined (<a href=https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2023-077310>FREE PDF</a>)  </p><p>Researchers propose these negative effects may be due to the altered nutritional composition of ultra-processed foods, their food additives, and changes to the food matrix from processing.While more research is needed to prove causality, experts argue the evidence is convincing enough to warrant population-level strategies to reduce consumption of ultra-processed foods. In the U.S., ultra-processed foods currently make up nearly 60% of adults&rsquo; diets and 70% of kids&rsquo; diets, so reducing intake could have a major positive impact on public health.</p><hr><h4

However, it is unclear whether food processing confers neurologic risk independent of dietary pattern information. We aimed to (1) investigate associations between UPFs and incident cognitive impairment and stroke and (2) compare these associations with other commonly recommended dietary patterns in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study. This prospective, observational cohort study enrolled Black and White adults in the United States from 2003 to 2007.</p><p>Methods</p><p>The NOVA system was used to categorize items from a baseline food frequency questionnaire according to the level of processing. Participants with incomplete or implausible self-reported dietary data were excluded. Consumption for each category (grams) was normalized to total grams consumed. Scores quantifying adherence to a Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet were also calculated. Incident cognitive impairment was defined using performance relative to a normative sample on memory and fluency assessments. Incident stroke was identified through adjudicated review of medical records.</p><p>Results</p><p>The cognitive impairment cohort (n = 14,175) included participants without evidence of impairment at baseline who underwent follow-up testing. The stroke cohort (n = 20,243) included participants without a history of stroke. In multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, a 10% increase in relative intake of UPFs was associated with higher risk of cognitive impairment (hazard ratio <span>[HR]</span> = 1.16, 95% CI 1.09–1.24, p = 1.01 × 10−5) and intake of unprocessed or minimally processed foods with lower risk of cognitive impairment (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.83–0.94, p = 1.83 × 10−4). Greater intake of UPFs (HR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.02–1.14, p = 1.12 × 10−2) and unprocessed or minimally processed foods (HR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.86–0.95, p = 2.13 × 10−4) were also associated with risk of stroke in multivariable Cox models. The effect of UPFs on stroke risk was greater among Black than White participants (UPF-by-race interaction HR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.03–1.29, p = 1.50 × 10−2). Associations between UPFs and both cognitive impairment and stroke were independent of adherence to the Mediterranean, DASH, and MIND diets.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>Food processing may be important to brain health in older adults independent of known risk factors and adherence to recommended dietary patterns.</p><hr><h4 id=the-perils-of-ultra-processed-foods-article-and-book---july-2023>The Perils of Ultra-processed foods (article and book) - July 2023</h4><p><strong><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/31/ultra-processed-people-chris-van-tulleken-book-review?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=pocket_hits&amp;utm_campaign=POCKET_HITS-EN-DAILY-RECS-2023_08_01&amp;sponsored=0&amp;position=1&amp;category=fascinating_stories&amp;scheduled_corpus_item_id=4d9eeec8-be80-4528-af49-df60fd51f788&amp;url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/31/ultra-processed-people-chris-van-tulleken-book-review">The Perils of Highly Processed Food</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>&ldquo;In the new book “Ultra-Processed People” (Norton), the British doctor and medical journalist Chris van Tulleken bravely turns himself into a&rdquo; guinea pig to explore the ins and outs of ultra-processed food (U.P.F.)—basically, food made up of substances that you would never find at home.</p></li><li><p>&mldr;.&ldquo;he reports of his U.P.F. diet. “But at the same time, I was no longer enjoying it.

High consumption of UPFs is associated with changes in the composition of gut microbiota, favoring the development of inflammation.

Aug 2024</h4><p>Based on the provided search results, there are several key points regarding the potential for vitamin D fortification to mitigate the negative health effects of consuming ultra-processed foods (UPFs):</p><ol><li><p>UPF consumption is associated with vitamin D deficiency. A cross-sectional study found that high intake of UPFs was linked to twice the risk of vitamin D deficiency compared to low UPF consumption. This suggests that the nutrient-poor profile of many UPFs may contribute to inadequate vitamin D intake and status.</p></li><li><p>Vitamin D is important for optimal health, including mental well-being. Deficiency in vitamin D, along with other nutrients like B vitamins, has been linked to an increased risk of depression. Ensuring adequate vitamin D intake is crucial for supporting overall health.</p></li><li><p>Some processed foods are already fortified with vitamin D. Certain milks, juices, and breakfast cereals may have vitamin D added to them. This indicates that fortification of UPFs with vitamin D is feasible from a food manufacturing perspective.</p></li><li><p>However, vitamin D fortification alone is unlikely to fully negate the health risks of UPFs. These foods are typically energy-dense and high in unhealthy components like added sugars, saturated fats, and salt, while being low in beneficial nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and minerals. The adverse health outcomes associated with UPFs, such as increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers, are likely due to multiple factors beyond just vitamin D content.</p></li></ol><p>In conclusion, while vitamin D fortification of UPFs may help address the issue of deficiency associated with high UPF intake, it is not a complete solution. Improving the overall nutritional profile of UPFs and emphasizing consumption of minimally processed, nutrient-dense whole foods should still be the primary strategies for promoting optimal health. More research is needed to fully understand the potential impact of vitamin D fortification on mitigating UPF-related health risks.</p><ul><li><strong><a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/search/might-the-health-problems-of-u-ECgwbsU8QUC2fv8U7SbPEQ>6 references</a></strong></li></ul><hr><p>So:</p><p>Taking Vitamin D will most likely reduce some of the problems resulting for ultra-processed foods</p><p>Notice that the UP food health problems include: increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancer</p><p>those risks are reduced by Vitamin D</p><p>In addition, supplementation reduces many other health problems associated with lower levels of Vitamin D (from any cause)</p><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/3-to-55-x-more-likely-to-have-these-health-problems-if-low-vitamin-d>3 to 55 X more likely to have these health problems if low Vitamin D</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/diseases-that-may-be-related-via-low-vitamin-d>Diseases that may be related via low vitamin D</a> huge table</p></li></ul></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>AI</span>
