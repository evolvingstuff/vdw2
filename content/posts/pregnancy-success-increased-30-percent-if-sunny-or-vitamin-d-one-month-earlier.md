### [Pregnancy chances increase among women who soak up sun a month before IVF, Belgium study says ](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/belgium-study-links-sun-exposure-ivf-pregnancy-article-1.2264264%20) NY Daily News

* Increased exposure to sunshine one month before conception could boost a woman's odds of getting pregnant through IVF by more than a third, according to the study out of Belgium.

* Dr. Frank Vandekerckhove, a reproduction specialist at University Hospital Ghent, found those exposed to more sunshine, less rain and higher temperatures one month before beginning an IVF cycle had better results.

* The study, which included more than 11,000 women, revealed the weather at the time of conception had no significance.

* "The month before is what's important, because that's when the egg is already starting to grow and mature," Vandekerckhove said.
