Aim To assess the frequency of low vitamin D levels and the level of calcidiol in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchial asthma (BA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in three regions of Russia.

Material and Method A total of 283 patients with CF, 160 with BA, 150 with JIA, and 333 healthy children in the con­trol group were examined in three regions of the Russian Fed­eration (Moscow region, Krasnoyarsk region, Stavropol region).

Results Normal concentration of 25(OH)D was detected in 49.3% of CF, insufficiency in 26.3%, deficiency in 16.7% of children, severe deficiency in 7.7% of patients. 

The maximum level of 25(OH)D was detected in the Moscow region (30.7 ng/ml), further in the Krasnoyarsk Territory (27.1 ng/ml), the minimum - in the Stavropol Territory (24.4 ng/ml). 

In the general group of patients with asthma, 89.62% had a low supply of vitamin D, severe deficiency 23.71%, deficiency 46.66%, insufficiency 19.25%. 

An analysis of the supply of vitamin D depending on the region of residence showed that a low supply of 25(OH)D is observed among 

* 70.6% of patients with asthma in the Moscow region, 

* 92.6% of patients in the Krasnoyarsk region and 

* all patients with asthma in the Stavropol region. (Near Ukraine)

Insufficient supply of vitamin D was found in 76% of children with JIA, vitamin D deficiency was detected in 38.0% of cases, severe deficiency in 10.0%; defi­ciency in 28.0%. 

The frequency of low vitamin D levels in the regions did not differ significantly: 

* Moscow region (73.9%), 

* Krasnoyarsk region (73.0%), 

* Stavropol region (73.1%),

but the frequency of severe deficiency was signifi­cantly higher among patients in Krasnoyarsk ( 17.6%) and Stavropol (16.7%) compared to Moscow (4.3%).

Conclusions Low vitamin D supply was revealed among chil­dren with cystic fibrosis in 50.7%, asthma in 89.6%, juvenile idiopathic arthritis in 76.0% in three regions of Russia.

#### The first Russian multicenter non-interventional registry study to study the incidence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in Russian Federation - 2021

Ter Arkh . 2021 Oct 15;93(10):1209-1216. [doi: 10.26442/00403660.2021.10.201071](https://doi.org/10.26442/00403660.2021.10.201071)

A Suplotova  1 , V A Avdeeva  1 , E A Pigarova  2 , L Y Rozhinskaya  2 , T L Karonova  3 , E A Troshina  2

Aim: To assess the incidence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency among the adult population living in the regions of the Russian Federation located at latitudes from 45 to 70.

Materials and methods: Russian multicenter non-interventional registry study using the "cross-sectional" method.

Results: In this study, 72.1% of the examined have the status of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency, while an adequate level was diagnosed in 27.8% of cases. When assessing the degree of vitamin D deficiency depending on the season, statistically significant differences (p0.00001) were found between the periods: vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency was observed in 84.2% of autumn and in 62.4% of spring. The highest incidence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency was recorded in males compared with females (p=0.013, 79 and 70.3% respectively). Vitamin D deficiency is observed in young people in the age subgroup of 1825 years (p0.001, 54% in the study as a whole) much more often than in older people 

Conclusion. The widespread high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the Russian Federation is not related to geographic region of residence, but to some extent depends on the season. The high-risk group for vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is young men. The significant role of vitamin D in the human body justifies the need to supplement and clarify a single concept for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of conditions associated with deficiency, so higher implementation of National Clinical Guidelines is needed.

#### Russia - Aug 2021 84% are deficient ( <20 ng) - April 2021

Background

In Russian Federation, there are no large-scale cross-sectional multicenter epidemiological studies assessing the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in different geographical latitudes. Insufficient solar insolation and inadequate vitamin D content in food dictate the need to study the epidemiological structure of low vitamin D status in Russia.

Aim

To assess the incidence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency among the population living in the regions of the Russian Federation located at latitudes from 45 ° to 70 °.

Materials and methods

The first stage of the Russian multicenter non-interventional registry study using the «crosssectional» method was carried out from March 2020 to May 2020.

Results

In regions that represent a geographically representative sample of regions of the Russian Federation with a high risk of developing low levels of vitamin D, it's deficiency was noted in 55.96%, and the level of deficiency and insufficiency was recorded in  **84.01%.** 

Conclusion

Close attention to the wide scale of the problem of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in the Russian Federation will contribute to the progressive formation of various educational and preventive programs necessary to strengthen health and improve the quality of life of the population.

#### Vitamin D status of the Russian adult population from 2013 to 2018 - Oct 2022 (24 ng?)

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread globally, however available data for the Russian adult population is fragmented. This cross-sectional study used secondary data for individuals undergoing testing for vitamin D concentrations from 2013 to 2018 by InVitro laboratory. 25(OH)D serum concentration was determined using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. The mean, median, and proportion with severe, deficient, insufficient and sufficient 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations were estimated. Splines examined the effect of latitude on 25(OH)D concentrations. Data were available for 30,040 subjects age ≥ 18 years. 24.2% of the sampled population had sufficient (30–< 150 25(OH)D ng/mL), 34% deficient (10–19.9 ng/mL) and 5.6% severely deficient (< 10 ng/mL) status. Average 25(OH)D concentrations were highest among 30–44 years and lowest amongst older adults; females had modestly higher values. Concentrations were 15% higher in fall/summer vs. winter/spring. A non-linear relationship was observed by latitude; the highest 25(OH)D concentrations were observed near 54°N, decreasing at more southern latitudes for women and more northern latitudes for both sexes. These results are comparable to other Northern European publications and limited Russian samples demonstrating low concentrations. Acknowledging that nationally-representative and randomly sampled data are needed, the present data suggest the burden may be high and identifies some population sub-groups and geographic areas with a higher potential deficiency of vitamin D.
