| (Left) Baseline VDD patients who undergo  **periodontal surgeries**  may be more prone to treatment failure due to the disturbance of bone formation and metabolism. | (Right) In  **periodontitis** , Vitamin D may promote P. gingivalis autophagy and anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of expression of inflammatory mediators, decreasing gingival inflammation |

Vitamin D (VD) levels have been gaining growing attention in Oral Health. During growth and adulthood, VD deficiency (VDD) is associated with a wide variety of oral health disorders, and impaired VD synthesis may expedite some of these conditions. In children, severe VDD can induce defective tooth mineralization, resulting in dentin and enamel defects. As a consequence, these defects may increase the risk of the onset and progression of dental caries. Further, VDD has been associated with higher prevalence of periodontitis and gingival inflammation, and several recent preclinical and clinical studies have unveiled potential pathways through which Vitamin D may interact with the periodontium. VDD correction through supplementation may contribute to a successful treatment of periodontitis; however, alveolar bone regeneration procedures performed in baseline VDD patients seem more prone to failure. Vitamin D may also be linked with some oral pathology entities such as certain oral cancers and events of osteonecrosis of the jaw. This review aims to provide comprehensive evidence of how VD levels should be considered to promote good oral health, and to summarize how VDD may hamper oral development and its role in certain oral conditions
