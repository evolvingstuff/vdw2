 **Highlights** 

* Deaths due to 18 specific cancers were the outcomes of interest in the UK Biobank.

* Vitamin D deficiency (VITD_D) and vitamin D supplements use (VITD_S) were assessed.

* VITD_D was associated with lung, colorectal, prostate, and stomach cancer mortality.

* VITD_S was significantly associated with 25% lower lung cancer mortality.

* Many lung cancer deaths may be preventable by VITD_S in people with VITD_D.

Background

Although the associations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and vitamin D supplementation with total cancer mortality are well-known, evidence regarding the association of 25(OH)D and cancer site-specific mortality is predominantly limited to common cancer types, and most studies on vitamin D supplementation use have limitations on sample size and adjustment of important confounding factors.

Methods

We used cause-specific Cox regression models adjusted for 48 covariates to assess the associations of vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency, and vitamin D supplementation use with mortality from any cancer and 18 specific cancers in 411,436 UK Biobank participants, aged 40-69 years.

Results

The majority of the study population had either vitamin D deficiency (21.1%) or insufficiency (34.4%). Furthermore, 4.1% and 20.3% of the participants regularly took vitamin D or multivitamin supplements, respectively. During a median follow-up of 12.7 years, vitamin D deficiency was associated with significantly increased mortality from total cancer and 4 specific cancers: stomach (hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval: 1.42, 1.05-1.92), colorectal (1.27, 1.07-1.50), lung (1.24, 1.10-1.40), and prostate (1.36, 1.06-1.75). Vitamin D insufficiency was associated with increased colorectal (1.14, 1.00-1.30) and lung cancer mortality (1.19, 1.08-1.32). Compared to non-users, vitamin D use was associated with lower lung cancer (0.75, 0.60-0.95) and total cancer mortality. Multivitamin use was associated with lower mortality from melanoma (0.64, 0.43-0.97).

Conclusion

Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were associated with increased mortality of multiple common cancers. The potential to reduce cancer mortality by vitamin D supplementation in populations with low 25(OH)D levels should be further explored.
