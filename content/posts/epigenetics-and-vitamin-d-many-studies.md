 **[Medium.com](https://yurideigin.medium.com/death-becomes-her-or-why-aging-is-an-epigenetic-program-c55a32fd8c74)** 

Mice have 800,000 sites, of which just over 20% change significantly with age.

* "...there are 10x (!) more gene pathways where methylation increases with age, which usually correlates with a decrease in gene expression, than pathways where the opposite happens"

#### Vitamin D, COPD, and Epigenetics – Aug 2011

 **Vitamin D and Susceptibility of Chronic Lung Diseases: Role of Epigenetics.** 

Front Pharmacol. 2011;2:50

Sundar IK, Rahman I.

Lung Biology and Disease Program, Department of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center Rochester, NY, USA.

Vitamin D deficiency is linked to accelerated decline in lung function, increased inflammation, and reduced immunity in chronic lung diseases. Epidemiological studies have suggested that vitamin D insufficiency is associated with low lung function in susceptible subjects who are exposed to higher levels of environmental agents (airborne particulates). Recent studies have highlighted the role of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) in regulation of several genes that are involved in inflammation, immunity, cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

Vitamin D has also been implicated in reversal of steroid resistance and airway remodeling, which are the hallmarks of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  **(COPD) and severe asthma** . VDR protein level is decreased in lungs of patients with COPD. VDR deficient mice develop an abnormal lung phenotype with characteristics of COPD, such as airspace enlargement and decline in lung function associated with increased lung inflammatory cellular influx, and immune-lymphoid aggregates formation.

Dietary vitamin D may regulate epigenetic events, in particular on genes which are responsible for COPD susceptibility. Active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) plays an essential role in cellular metabolism and differentiation via its nuclear receptor (VDR) that cooperates with several other chromatin modification enzymes (histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases), thereby mediating complex epigenetic events in vitamin D signaling and metabolism.

This review provides an update on the current knowledge and understanding on vitamin D, and susceptibility of chronic lung diseases in relation to the possible role of epigenetics in its molecular action. Understanding the molecular epigenetic mechanism of vitamin D/VDR would provide rationale for dietary vitamin D-mediated intervention in prevention and management of chronic lung diseases linked with vitamin D deficiency.

#### Noteable Epigenetics and Vitamin D studies [by Perplexity AI April 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Please-provide-a-kzO7NLw3Tgm5AjRxVrN.zQ)

1.  **Maternal Vitamin D Depletion and DNA Methylation** 

> A study published in Clinical Epigenetics in 2016 found that maternal vitamin D status plays a crucial role in determining DNA methylation states in both the germline and soma across multiple generations. This study demonstrated that maternal vitamin D depletion can lead to long-term effects on the epigenome of subsequent generations, suggesting that vitamin D-induced changes in methylation are likely the result of sporadic epimutations due to global dysregulation  [1](https://clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13148-016-0276-4).

1.  **Vitamin D, DNA Methylation, and Breast Cancer** 

> Research from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences explored the relationships between serum vitamin D levels, DNA methylation, and breast cancer risk. This study utilized a case-cohort sample to examine the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and methylation within a random sample of the cohort, focusing on 198 CpG loci in or near seven vitamin D-related genes [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6042268](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6042268).

1.  **Vitamin D and Epigenetic Aging** 

> A study published in GeroScience in 2022 analyzed the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and epigenetic aging. The findings suggested that vitamin D supplementation is associated with slower epigenetic aging, highlighting the potential of vitamin D in influencing biological age through epigenetic mechanisms[5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-022-00581-9).

1.  **Vitamin D and Autoimmunity** 

> A review in NCBI discussed the role of vitamin D as a nutri-epigenetic factor in autoimmunity. The review highlighted how vitamin D might alter the risk of diseases like colorectal cancer by mediating the methylation of Wnt regulatory genes, demonstrating the epigenetic influence of vitamin D in disease modulation [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9611618/).

1.  **Systematic Review on Vitamin D and Epigenetics** 

> A systematic review until 2023 examined the epigenetic modulation of vitamin D-related genes and its impact on vitamin D levels. The review summarized literature assessing the association between epigenetic modification of genes involved in the vitamin D metabolic pathway and the status of vitamin D metabolites, indicating significant variance in vitamin D levels due to epigenetic modifications [2](https://archpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13690-023-01122-2).
