#### Puberty Starts Earlier Than It Used To. No One Knows Why

 **[Ney York Times - May 18, 2022](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/science/early-puberty-medical-reason.html?)** 

* "Some girls are starting to develop breasts as early as age 6 or 7."

* "Researchers are studying the role of obesity, chemicals and stress."

* "The decline was even more striking in Black girls, who had begun developing breasts, on average, at age 9."

   * Not a surprise, blacks have even lower vitamin d levels than whites

* "Studies in the decades since have confirmed, in dozens of countries, that the age of puberty in girls has dropped by about three months per decade since the 1970s. A similar pattern, though less extreme, has been observed in boys."
