## Video by Dr. Hollick titled [Breast milk can be a good a good source of vitamin D](http://videos.huffingtonpost.com/parents/how-breast-milk-can-be-a-good-source-of-vitamin-d-235166474) by Huffingtonpost

In the video Dr. Hollick specifically says that Breast milk is NOT a good source of vitamin D. 

The exact opposite of the title in Huffintonpost.

Another 1 minute video at Huffintonpost titled “How Women Can Overdose From Vitamin D” totally is wrong.

Dr. Holick says in that video that it is very difficult to overdose.

 **By the way, Huffintonpost has made so many completely wrong statements on Vitamin D during the past year, which I have commented on, that they have banned me from making any more comments.**
