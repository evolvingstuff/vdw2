Most doctors limit their vitamin D prescriptions to 2,000 IU

The doctors training (incorrectly) told them that any more than 2,000 IU could be toxic

At least one [Randomize Controlled Trial had to stop the 2,000 IU leg](/posts/breastfeeding-mother-getting-6400-iu-of-vitamin-d-is-similar-to-infant-getting-400-iu-rct)

because 2000 IU was not providing the healthful outcome that the 4,000 IU leg provided.
