### [Compositions for Providing Vitamin D Year Round and Uses Thereof](http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&r=12&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PG01&S1=%28%22vitamin+d%22.TTL.%29&OS=ttl/%22vitamin+d%22&RS=TTL/%22vitamin+d%22)

Methods for enhancing the ability of an individual, exposed to sunlight, to produce vitamin D via the skin. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising provitamin D and at least one of  **lumisterol and tachysterol** and analogs and derivatives thereof are also disclosed.

 **Claim 1** 

A composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and an effective amount of (a) provitamin D or a derivative or analog thereof; (b) at least one of lumisterol and tachysterol or analogs and/or esters thereof, and (c) a pharmaceutically effective carrier, wherein (a) and (b) are present in amounts effective to provide vitamin D or derivatives or analogs and/or esters thereof to an individual at a particular latitude and/or time of the year.

 **Description** 

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

<sup>[0001]</sup> The invention is in the field of cosmetics and medicinal chemistry. In particular, the present invention relates to topical compositions which provide vitamin D and derivatives thereof throughout the year. The topical compositions of the invention  **allow a user in the high northern and southern latitudes to produce previtamin D on their skin even when exposed to low energy sunlight in the winter as well as in the morning and evening throughout the year** . The compositions comprise provitamin D and at least one of tachysterol and lumisterol, and derivatives and analogs thereof, which photoisomerize to previtamin D, and analogs and derivatives thereof.

 **SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION** 

<sup>[0015]</sup> The present invention is related to the discovery that topical formulations comprising provitamin D and derivatives and analogs thereof together with at least one of lumisterol and tachysterol and derivatives and analogs thereof are effective means of providing vitamin D to individuals throughout the year. The present invention utilizes the low energy UV photoconversion of lumisterol and tachysterol and derivatives and analogs thereof to previtamin D and derivatives and analogs thereof during the winter months and high energy UV photoconversion of provitamin D and derivatives and analogs thereof to previtamin D and derivatives and analogs thereof in the summer months as a method of producing vitamin D and derivatives and analogs thereof in the skin throughout the year.

## Comment by VitaminDWiki

If this works, it will be a real breakthru for getting vitamin D: 

1. off season, 

1. other than middle of the day (too hot), 

1. by seniors

1. perhaps those with dark skins
