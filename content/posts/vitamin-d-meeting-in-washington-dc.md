### [Vitamin D: Moving Toward Evidence-based Decision Making in Primary Care](http://ods.od.nih.gov/Research/VitaminDConference2014.aspx)

Dec 2, 3 2014

 **Summary notes by VitaminDWiki** 

* There may be a problem for vitamin D levels > 50 ng

* People need a lot more vitamin D than they are getting

* Controversey as to how much - little conversation about basing dose size on weight

* Groups who are at high risk of being deficient - they acknowledge only elderly, blacks, excessive clothes so far

* Testing inaccuracy continues to be a big problem

* Blacks need a lower level than whites - continues to be a controversy

* Genes are important, and vitamin D deficiency can be inherited

* Virtually no discussion on importance of cofactors
