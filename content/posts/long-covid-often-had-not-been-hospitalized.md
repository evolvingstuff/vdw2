#### Over 75 Percent of Long Covid Patients Were Not Hospitalized for Initial Illness, Study Finds

 **[New York Times May 18, 2022](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/18/health/long-covid-hospitalization.html)** 

("Another striking finding was that while two-thirds of the patients had pre-existing health conditions in their medical records, nearly a third did not, a much larger percentage than Dr. Ssentongo said he would have expected. “These are people who have been healthy and they’re like, ‘Guys, something is not right with me,’” he said."

* "Nearly 35 percent of the patients were between the ages of 36 to 50, while nearly one-third were ages 51 to 64, and 17 percent were ages 23 to 35. Children were also diagnosed with post-Covid conditions: Nearly 4 percent of the patients were 12 or younger, while nearly 7 percent were between ages 13 and 22."

* "Ms. Gelburd and other experts said the scores suggested that the repercussions of long Covid are not simply confined to  **increased medical spending** . They signal “how many people are  **leaving their jobs, how many are being given disability status, how much absenteeism**  is there in school,"

* "muscle problems occurred 11 times more often in the patients with long Covid, 

   * pulmonary embolisms occurred 2.6 times more often and

   * certain types of brain-related disorders occurred two times more often..."
