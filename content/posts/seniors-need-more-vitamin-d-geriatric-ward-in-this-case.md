#### Vitamin D Status among Patients Admitted to a Geriatric Ward-Are Recommendations for Preventing Its Deficiency Effective Enough?

Nutrients 2024 Jan 6;16(2):193. [doi: 10.3390/nu16020193.](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16020193.)

Despite a decade of available recommendations aimed at preventing vitamin D (VD) deficiency in Poland, the efficacy of these measures among community-dwelling older individuals remains inconsistent. The PolSenior2 study provided valuable insights into VD status among community-dwelling older individuals in Poland. However, it is important to note that this research did not include the elderly living in care institutions. Therefore, our study concentrates on evaluating VD status in older patients admitted to a geriatrics ward to indirectly assess their adherence to existing recommendations and preventive actions in this particular setting (whether they translate into health-promoting behaviors (i.e., taking vitamin D supplements) and whether the recommended, optimal 25(OH)D concentration values are achieved). This approach offers a comprehensive understanding of VD status in a previously understudied population. We aimed to evaluate VD status in patients aged 70 and above within the geriatrics ward, exploring its association with age, sex, BMI, and the use of VD supplements. The study involved the measurement of serum VD concentration in 240 individuals. Of these participants, 177 (73.8%) were women, and 193 (80.4%) were over 75 years old. 

The median 25(OH)D concentration was found to be 22.95 (IQR, 13.7-33.0) ng/mL. 

Notably, profound deficiency (<10 ng/mL) was noted in 15% of the participants, while 67.5% exhibited VD inadequacy (<30 ng/mL). 

It is worth mentioning that only 18.3% of individuals took VD supplements preadmission. Insufficiency was more prevalent in nonsupplemented individuals (70.9% vs. 52.3%, p = 0.02) and those with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (76.2% vs. 59.2%, p = 0.007). 

The logistic regression model demonstrated that obese patients had over two times higher odds of VD inadequacy (OR = 2.21, p = 0.0074), as did nonsupplemented individuals (OR = 2.23, p = 0.0187). The high prevalence of VD deficiency and inadequacy in geriatric ward admissions emphasizes the urgent need for targeted interventions and enhanced education for older adults, caregivers, and physicians to improve adherence to preventive supplementation practices.
