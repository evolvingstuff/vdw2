Dear Sir,

Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with several autoimmune disorders and increased autoimmune responses in healthy individuals. One of many potential factors underlying this association is the well-established anti-inflammatory action of vitamin D administration resulting in reduced proinflammatory cytokine production and enhanced regulatory T cell activity <sup>[1]</sup>. Although vitamin D deficiency is well known in multiple sclerosis (MS) <sup>[2]</sup>, its significance in neuromyelitis optica (NMO), another autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), is less well understood. NMO, NMO spectrum disorder and recurrent transverse myelitis patients have been recently shown to display reduced vitamin D levels <sup>[3, 4]</sup>. Although, these studies have shed some light on the impact of vitamin D on NMO pathogenesis, associations between vitamin D levels and clinical–demographic features of NMO patients are yet to be characterized.  . . .
