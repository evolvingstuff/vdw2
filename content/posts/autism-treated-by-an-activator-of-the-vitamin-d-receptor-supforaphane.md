#### New Study Shows Promise for Natural Support of Autism Symptoms - March 2024

 **[GreenMedInfo](https://greenmedinfo.com/content/new-study-shows-promise-natural-support-autism-symptoms)** 

* "A new double-blind, placebo-controlled study published in Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences shows exciting potential for sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli sprouts, to help ease symptoms of irritability and hyperactivity in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)."

  * "After 10 weeks, the sulforaphane group showed significantly greater improvements in irritability scores and hyperactivity/noncompliance scores compared to placebo. However, no differences were seen between groups in other symptom areas like lethargy, stereotypic behavior, or inappropriate speech."

* " A study published in Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences found that when used as an adjunctive treatment alongside  **risperidone** , sulforaphane significantly improved symptoms of irritability and hyperactivity in children with ASD compared to placebo."

* "Early studies associate sulforaphane with reduced risks for cardiovascular disease, asthma, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.8 It has been shown to support liver function, blood sugar balance, eye health, skin reactions, detoxification and even slowing the aging process itself. With over 250 recorded health benefits, sulforaphane's therapeutic potential appears tremendous.9"

Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, 74(7), pp.398-405.

!!!!New Study Shows Promise for Natural Support of Autism Symptoms - March 2024
__[https://greenmedinfo.com/content/new-study-shows-promise-natural-support-autism-symptoms|GreenMedInfo]__
*&quot;A new double-blind, placebo-controlled study published in Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences shows exciting potential for sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli sprouts, to help ease symptoms of irritability and hyperactivity in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&quot;
**&quot;After 10 weeks, the sulforaphane group showed significantly greater improvements in irritability scores and hyperactivity/noncompliance scores compared to placebo. However, no differences were seen between groups in other symptom areas like lethargy, stereotypic behavior, or inappropriate speech.&quot;
*&quot; A study published in Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences found that when used as an adjunctive treatment alongside __risperidone__, sulforaphane significantly improved symptoms of irritability and hyperactivity in children with ASD compared to placebo.&quot;
*&quot;Early studies associate sulforaphane with reduced risks for cardiovascular disease, asthma, schizophrenia, Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and Parkinson&#39;s disease.8 It has been shown to support liver function, blood sugar balance, eye health, skin reactions, detoxification and even slowing the aging process itself. With over 250 recorded health benefits, sulforaphane&#39;s therapeutic potential appears tremendous.9&quot;
