#### Association of time spent outdoors with the risk of Parkinson&#39;s disease: a prospective cohort study of 329,359 participants

16% reduced risk if outdoors for &gt; 5 hrs

Suspect 60% reduced risk if outdoors, lying down, with minimal clothing for 1 hour

Suspect 60% reduced risk if take a 50,000 IU vitamin capsule once every 2 weeks

Background: Studies on the association between time spent outdoors and the development of Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) are lacking, and whether this relationship differs in different subgroups (age, sex) remains unclear.

Objective: We here examined the association between time spent outdoors and the incidence of PD in different seasons.

Methods: This study included 329,359 participants from the UK Biobank. Data regarding hours spent outdoors during a typical day were obtained through questionnaires. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between exposure to outdoors duration and PD incidence. Restricted cubic spline was used to explore the potential nonlinear relationship between time spent outdoors and PD risk. To explore the potential mechanisms of time spent outdoors effecting the risk of PD incidence, their association with serum vitamin D was further analysed separately.

Results: During a median follow-up of 13.57 years, 2,238 participants developed PD. In summer, time spent outdoors &gt; 5.0 h/day was associated with a reduced PD risk compared with â‰¤ 2.0 h/day (HR = 0.84, 95% CI, 0.74-0.95). In winter too, time spent outdoors &gt; 2.0 h/day was also associated with a reduced PD risk compared with â‰¤ 1.0 h/day (HR = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.76-0.94). For annual average time spent outdoors, participants who went outdoors for more than 3.5 h/day had a reduced PD risk than those who went outdoors for â‰¤ 1.5 h/day (HR = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.75-0.96). Additionally, sex and age differences were observed in the association between time spent outdoors and the PD risk. Moreover, Time spent outdoors was observed to be positively associated with serum vitamin D levels. Compared with serum vitamin D-deficient participants, the risk of PD was reduced by 15% in the sufficient participants.

Conclusion: In the total population, higher time spent outdoors was linked to a reduced PD risk. However, this association may vary among different age or sex groups.

!!!!Association of time spent outdoors with the risk of Parkinson&#39;s disease: a prospective cohort study of 329,359 participants

16% reduced risk if outdoors for &gt; 5 hrs
Suspect 60% reduced risk if outdoors, lying down, with minimal clothing for 1 hour
Suspect 60% reduced risk if take a 50,000 IU vitamin capsule once every 2 weeks

Background: Studies on the association between time spent outdoors and the development of Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) are lacking, and whether this relationship differs in different subgroups (age, sex) remains unclear.

Objective: We here examined the association between time spent outdoors and the incidence of PD in different seasons.

Methods: This study included 329,359 participants from the UK Biobank. Data regarding hours spent outdoors during a typical day were obtained through questionnaires. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between exposure to outdoors duration and PD incidence. Restricted cubic spline was used to explore the potential nonlinear relationship between time spent outdoors and PD risk. To explore the potential mechanisms of time spent outdoors effecting the risk of PD incidence, their association with serum vitamin D was further analysed separately.

Results: During a median follow-up of 13.57 years, 2,238 participants developed PD. In summer, time spent outdoors &gt; 5.0 h/day was associated with a reduced PD risk compared with â‰¤ 2.0 h/day (HR = 0.84, 95% CI, 0.74-0.95). In winter too, time spent outdoors &gt; 2.0 h/day was also associated with a reduced PD risk compared with â‰¤ 1.0 h/day (HR = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.76-0.94). For annual average time spent outdoors, participants who went outdoors for more than 3.5 h/day had a reduced PD risk than those who went outdoors for â‰¤ 1.5 h/day (HR = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.75-0.96). Additionally, sex and age differences were observed in the association between time spent outdoors and the PD risk. Moreover, Time spent outdoors was observed to be positively associated with serum vitamin D levels. Compared with serum vitamin D-deficient participants, the risk of PD was reduced by 15% in the sufficient participants.

Conclusion: In the total population, higher time spent outdoors was linked to a reduced PD risk. However, this association may vary among different age or sex groups.
