Food insecurity and the nutrition transition have been noted in arctic communities. We therefore evaluated biomarkers of nutritional status and nutrient intakes by TF and food security status among Inuit in Canada. A cross-sectional health survey of Inuit (?18 y) in 36 arctic communities was conducted in 2007-2008. Food security was assessed by 24-h  **dietary recalls**  using USDA questionnaires and nutrient intakes. 

Biomarkers included serum 25(OH)D, hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and erythrocyte RBC FA. Analyses were stratified by past-day TF consumption (yes vs. no) and food security status (secure vs. insecure). Food insecurity was prevalent (62.6%) and associated with higher RBC trans-FA and lower hemoglobin levels and serum ferritin, whereas 

TF consumption was associated with higher serum 25(OH)D, (n-3) FA, and serum ferritin (P ? 0.05). 

In men, food insecurity was associated with lower intake of energy and energy-adjusted fiber, vitamin C, iron, zinc, and magnesium. 

In women, food insecurity was associated with a higher intake of carbohydrates and lower intake of fiber, DFE, vitamin C, iron, magnesium, calcium, and  **vitamin D_. 

For both sexes, when TF was consumed, there was a higher intake of protein, protein-related micronutrients, and vitamins A and C and a lower intake of carbohydrates, saturated fat, and fiber and a lower sodium:potassium ratio (P ? 0.05). Nutrition transition and food insecurity are associated with a multifaceted shift in nutrient status and intakes with implications for** increased risk of diet-sensitive chronic diseases. **PMID:     21753059

Aboriginal populations living above the Arctic Circle are at particularly high risk of vitamin D deficiency due to

* limited ultraviolet B exposure (related to geographic latitude) and 

* inadequate dietary intake (recently related to decreased traditional food consumption). 

Major changes in diet and lifestyle over the past 50 years in these populations have coincided with increased prevalence rates of 

* rickets, 

* cancer, 

* diabetes, and 

* obesity, 

each of which may be associated with vitamin D inadequacy. 

This review examines the risk factors for vitamin D inadequacy, the associations between vitamin D and disease risk at high geographic latitudes, and the recommendations for improving vitamin D status particularly among aboriginal Arctic populations. Traditional foods, such as fatty fish and marine mammals, are rich sources of vitamin D and should continue to be promoted to improve dietary vitamin D intake. Supplementation protocols may also be necessary to ensure adequate vitamin D status in the Arctic.
