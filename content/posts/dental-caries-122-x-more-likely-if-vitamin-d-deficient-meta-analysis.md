#### Correlation between vitamin D levels in serum and the risk of dental caries in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis

BMC Oral Health . 2023 Oct 19;23(1):768. [doi: 10.1186/s12903-023-03422-z.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-023-03422-z.)

Background: Vitamin D plays a crucial role in oral health, and its deficiency is associated to significant changes in oral health diseases. We aimed to explore the relationship between levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D) and dental caries in children.

Methods: Four electronic databases were searched by two investigators including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Dental caries results were presented as either prevalence or based on the index of primary and permanent teeth/surfaces with decaying, missing, and filled areas, while vitamin D levels were determined through laboratory testing. Two researchers independently selected studies, collected information, assessed risk of bias, and evaluated the study quality. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion.

Results: A total of 13 studies were included, comprising 5 cross-sectional studies, 5 cohort studies, 3 case-control studies, all of which had high methodological quality. Our meta-analysis showed that children with vitamin D deficiency had a 22% higher risk of dental caries than those with normal vitamin D levels, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.22 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.18 to 1. 25. Further subgroup analysis according to the three types of studies showed that the risk of dental caries in children with vitamin D deficiency was higher than that in normal vitamin D level group (cohort studies: 62%; cross-sectional studies, 19%; and case-control studies, 5%). Additionally, according to age, subgroup analysis also showed that the risk of dental caries in children with vitamin D deficiency was higher than that in normal vitamin D level group (permanent teeth studies, 28%; deciduous teeth studies, 68%; and mixed dentition studies 8%).

Conclusions: Levels of 25 (OH) D have been found negatively associated with dental caries in children, indicating that low vitamin D levels may be considered a potential risk factor to this dental disease.
