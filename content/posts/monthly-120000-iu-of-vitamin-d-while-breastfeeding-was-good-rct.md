Background: There is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) in exclusively breast-fed infants in the absence of appropriate vitamin D supplementation.

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of two doses of maternal vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D levels of mother-infant pairs and to assess its effect on growth parameters(weight, length and head circumference) and bone mass of infants.

Study design: Randomized controlled trial.

Participants: Lactating mother-infant pairs (n=220).

Intervention: Maternal oral vitamin D supplementation in two doses (group 1: 120 000 IU/month and group 2: 12000 IU/month for 12 months.

Main-outcomes: Maternal and infant serum 25OHD levels, and infant's growth and bone mass.

Results: There was high prevalence of VDD at baseline in mothers (94%) as well as infants (98.5%) which was reduced to 43.1% in (mothers) and 46.5% in infants after 12 months. Significantly higher median (IQR) serum 25OHD levels (ng/mL) were observed among mothers in group 1 compared to group 2 <span>[46 (17-159) vs 18 (6-64); P<0.01]</span> and in infants <span>[36.5 (15-160) vs 17 (7-32); P<0.01]</span>. No significant association was observed between growth parameters or bone mass and serum 25OHD levels of mother or infant between the two groups. Four mothers (3.6%) and two infants (1.8%) in group I had serum 25OHD>100 ng/mL, but without hypercalciuria or hypercalcemia.

Conclusion: Bolus vitamin D supplementation in the dose of 1,20,000IU/month was more efficacious in improving maternal and infant vitamin D status at 12 months, as compared to 12,000 IU/month.
