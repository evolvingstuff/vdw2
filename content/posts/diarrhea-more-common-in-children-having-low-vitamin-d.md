Over the past decade, interest has grown in the role of vitamin D in many non skeletal medical conditions. The immunemodulatory properties of vitamin D may influence susceptibility to infection. This cross sectional study aimed to study the association between vitamin D level and recurrent acute diarrhea. The study was conducted on 80 simple randomly selected children, aged from 4 to 12 years from November 2013 to May 2014, sixty patients were suffering from recurrent acut diarrhea and twenty were healthy, age and sex matched children taken as a control group. All children were subjected to complete history taking, clinical examination and Laboratory investigations in the form of hemoglobin level, stool analysis and estimation of the serum level of vitamin D by ELISA. There was highly significant decrease in vitamin D levels in patients group than control group. In patients with recurrent acute diarrhea, vitamin D deficiency was found in 58%, insufficient in 20 % and sufficient in 22%. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased rate of diarrheal attacks, vomiting and abdominal pain. Hemoglobin level was decreased below normal in 26.7% of children with recurrent diarrhea; most of them were vitamin D deficient children. Stool examination in children with recurrent diarrhea detected Entameba histolytica in 8.3%, Giardia lamblia in 13%, Ascaris lumbricoides in 1.7% and Ancylostoma duodenal in 1.7%, all parasites were detected in vitamin D deficient children, except E. histolytica detected also in vitamin D sufficient child. Recurrent acute diarrhea was associated with decreased serum level of vitamin D in preschool and school-age children. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased number of diarrheal attacks and Giardia lamblia parasitic infection.
