Remarks

* This recommendation supersedes the previous WHO recommendation found in the 2012 Guideline: vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women (1).

* Pregnant women should be advised that sunlight is the most important source of vitamin D. The amount of time needed in the sun is not known and depends on many variables, such as the amount of skin exposed, the time of day, latitude and season, skin pigmentation (darker skin pigments synthesize less vitamin D than lighter pigments) and sunscreen use (1).

* Pregnant women should be encouraged to receive adequate nutrition, which is best achieved through consumption of a healthy, balanced diet, and to refer to WHO guidance on healthy eating (2).

* For pregnant women with  **documented vitamin D deficiency** , vitamin D supplements may be given at the current recommended nutrient intake (RNI) of  **200 IU**  (5 µg) per day.

* According to the Cochrane review, there are 23 ongoing or unpublished studies on vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy (3). Evidence from these trials should help to clarify the current uncertainties regarding vitamin D effects, particularly the effect on preterm birth, and any other associated benefits or harms of vitamin D when combined with other vitamins and minerals, particularly calcium.

* This is an extract from the relevant guideline (4). Additional guidance information can be found in these documents.
