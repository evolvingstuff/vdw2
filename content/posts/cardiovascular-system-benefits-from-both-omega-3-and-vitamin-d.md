### Omega-3 Fatty acids and vitamin d in cardiology.

Cardiol Res Pract. 2012;2012:729670. [doi: 10.1155/2012/729670.](https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/729670.) Epub 2012 Dec 31.

Dietary modification and supplementation play an increasingly important role in the conservative treatment of cardiovascular disease. Current interest has focused on n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and vitamin D. Clinical trial results on this subject are contradictory in many aspects. Several studies indicate that n-3 PUFA consumption improves 

* vascular and cardiac hemodynamics, 

* triglycerides, and 

* possibly 

> endothelial function, 

> autonomic control, 

> inflammation, 

> thrombosis, and 

> arrhythmia. 

 **Experimental studies**  show effects on 

* membrane structure and associated functions, 

* ion channel properties, 

* genetic regulation, and 

* production of anti-inflammatory mediators. 

Clinical trials evaluating a possible reduction in cardiovascular disease by n-3 PUFA have shown different results. 

Supplementation of vitamin D is common regarding prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. But vitamin D also seems to have several effects on the cardiovascular system. 

Vitamin D deficiency appears to be related to an 

* increase in parathyroid hormone levels and 

* can predispose to essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, 

* increased insulin resistance, and 

* eventually to atherosclerosis and adverse cardiovascular events. 

Randomized prospective clinical trials are needed to determine whether vitamin D and omega-3 FA supplementation therapy should be recommended as a routine therapy for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
