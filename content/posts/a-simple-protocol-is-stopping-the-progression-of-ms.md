Nice narrative overview

 **A portion of it = Treatment for All Autoimmune Diseases** 

The Coimbra protocol seems to be just as effective at lowering and ceasing symptoms of other progressive autoimmune diseases. This is because the dysregulated immune system is brought into balance by vitamin D, believed to have a role in T lymphocyte cell production. T cells are produced in response to fighting disease and pathogens.

Coimbra discovered, for instance, that vitiligo lesions diminished in a patient using the protocol for Parkinsonâ€™s disease. And the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and MS is well-established in scientific, peer-reviewed studies.

Coimbra supervised a study in 2013 on the effect of prolonged high-dose vitamin D supplementation with nine psoriasis and 19 vitiligo patients. They received 35,000 IU daily for six months with a low-calcium diet and high hydration. The condition of patients significantly improved during treatment, with no negative side effects.

In 2011, a study conducted with 209 patients of systemic lupus erythematosus by the Ohio State University Medical Center found that the majority of patients included in the study had vitamin D deficiency. The authors found the more vitamin D in the blood, the lower the lupus disease activity, and vice versa.
