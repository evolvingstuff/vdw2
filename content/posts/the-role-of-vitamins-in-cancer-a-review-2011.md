Vitamins are essential nutrients for human metabolism, playing an important role as coenzymes or enzymes in many vital processes for the normal functioning of the body. In recent years, it has become apparent that vitamins are crucial in health and human disease, due to several studies that studied this relationship. Currently, it is known that vitamins can have an important role in the prevention and treatment of cancer, but until now no conclusive results were obtained. In this review, we will present the work and more relevant conclusions obtained in recent years of investigation about the relationship between vitamins and cancer, namely vitamin A, vitamin B complex, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K.
