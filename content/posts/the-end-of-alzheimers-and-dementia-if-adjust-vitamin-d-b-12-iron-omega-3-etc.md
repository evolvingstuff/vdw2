#### ReCODE: The Reversal of Cognitive Decline = Mercola 2017

[ReCODE: The Reversal of Cognitive Decline](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2017/08/27/reverse-cognitive-decline.aspx?utm_source=dnl&utm_medium=email&utm_content=art1&utm_campaign=20170827Z1_UCM&et_cid=DM156459&et_rid=29590801%20) Mercola 2017

 **Story at-a-glance** 

* Dr. Dale Bredesen’s ReCODE protocol evaluates 150 factors known to contribute to Alzheimer’s disease. This identifies your disease subtype or combination of subtypes, and an effective treatment protocol can be devised

* Type 1 Alzheimer’s is primarily caused by inflammatory factors; type 2 involves atrophic responses; type 1.5 is a mix of inflammation and atrophy, and type 3 is primarily caused by toxic exposures

* Only 5 percent of Alzheimer’s cases are “familial” Alzheimer’s disease, a genetic condition that causes early onset Alzheimer’s; the rest are caused by lifestyle factors over which we have a great deal of control; hence, we have the ability to improve or even reverse most cases of the disease

Includes interview and transcript of Dr. Bredesen, author

#### 4 Alzheimer’s Subtypes

While these classifications have not become widely accepted yet, Bredesen has published two papers on Alzheimer’s subtypes, based on metabolic profiling.4 These include:

* 1. **Type 1** , inflammatory ( **“hot”** ) Alzheimer’s: Patients present predominantly inflammatory symptoms. They have high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha, reflecting a chronic inflammatory state. When the NF-ĸB part of inflammation is activated, it also alters gene transcription. Two of the genes turned “on” are beta-secretase and gamma-secretase, the latter of which cleaves APP, thereby promoting synaptoclastic processes.

* 2.  **Type 1.5,**  glycotoxic (sugar-toxic, “ **sweet** , a mixed subtype: This is an in-between subtype that involves both inflammation and atrophy processes, due to insulin resistance and glucose-induced inflammation.

* 3.  **Type 2,**  atrophic or “ **cold** ”Alzheimer’s: This is classified as patients presenting an atrophic response. While a completely different mechanism from inflammation, it produces the same end result — it pushes APP in the direction of creating amyloid plaques and Alzheimer’s cell signaling.

* 4.  **Type 3,**  toxic (“ **vile** ”) Alzheimer’s: These are patients with toxic exposures. Many will have chronic inflammatory response syndrome (CIRS) markers, even though most do not fit the official criteria for CIRS. “They act like CIRS patients (in their labs, not necessarily symptoms) with dementia,” Bredesen explains.

 **Sections of the article include** 

* If You’re ApoE4 Positive, Fasting Is Strongly Indicated to Avoid Alzheimer’s

* Mitochondrial Dysfunction Is at the Heart of Alzheimer’s

* The ReCODE protocol evaluates 150 different variables, including biochemistry, genetics and historical imaging, to determine which factors are most likely driving the disease.

   * "Sterling, a neurorehabilitation specialist who focuses on Parkinson’s, and Dr. Bredesen discussed the mechanisms behind cognitive decline and the need to “flip the script” on the current approach of treating diseases Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Lewy Body Dementia, and other forms of neurodegeneration using a precision medicine approach that identifies an individual’s contributors and establishes a treatment plan that reverses symptoms and prevents these diseases"

   * "Today, Dr. Craig Tanio, Dr. Dale Bredesen and I will all be discussing multi-modal approaches to neurocognitive decline, his latest research study on Alzheimer’s disease, his upcoming books, mechanisms into Alzheimer’s disease, ALS,  **Parkinson’s disease** , macular degeneration, and much more."

1. Vascular dementia.

1. Normal pressure hydrocephalus.  etc.

1. Frontotemporal dementia,

1. LATE. Limbic-predominant age-associated TDP-43 encephalopathy.
