Objective. To estimate the prevalence of magnesium deficiency (MD) and the characteristics of clinical symptoms in women with climacteric syndrome (CS) and to determine the efficacy of Magne B6 forte in improving the quality of life in patients.

Subjects and methods. A total of 3808 women with climacteric syndrome were examined. In the first phase of the study, the symptoms of CS and the prevalence of MD were assessed using the standardized Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and/or serum magnesium levels were measured. The quality of life in the women with CS was estimated according to the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. In the second step, the patients with MD were treated with a magnesium citrate-containing drug for 4 weeks; the therapeutic efficiency was evaluated.

Results. The high prevalence of MD was noted in the patients with CS (60%). The clinical efficacy of Magne B,6 forte was confirmed by an 

* increase in  **serum**  magnesium levels (from 0.67±0.09 to 0.80±0.25 mmol/l; p < 0.001), 

* normalization of MDQ scores (from 43.4±11.9 to 24.0±14.9; p < 0.001), 

* a reduction in the severity of more than half of the CS symptoms by 2-2.5 times and 

* an improvement in quality of life.

Conclusion. The use of Magne B6 forte in patients with CS contributes to improvements in the course of the disease and in the quality of life.
