Deficiency has been demonstrated in IF patients dependent on home parenteral nutrition.2 We aimed to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in hospital patients with IF and the efficacy of subsequent prescribed treatment.</p><p>Methods All patients admitted to St Mark&rsquo;s Hospital with IF over a 12-month period were included and data on demographics, serum total vitamin D concentration, IF aetiology and vitamin D supplementation prescribed were obtained. If deficiency was identified (?50?nmol/l) the efficacy of treatment provided was assessed. Descriptive analysis and t-tests were performed.</p><p>Results Eighty-four patients were included in the study (42 female, mean age 53±15?years, 92% Caucasian). The aetiology of IF included</p><ul><li><p>short bowel (n=30),</p></li><li><p>fistula (n=34),</p></li><li><p>small bowel obstruction (n=13),</p></li><li><p>malabsorption (n=5) and</p></li><li><p>others (n=2).</p></li></ul><p>Vitamin D was measured in 76% (n=64) of patients and 75% (n=48) were deficient (mean 41±25?nmol/l, range 9–126).</p><p>Vitamin D concentrations were</p><ul><li><p>lower in men (33.4±15.3?nmol/l) compared to</p></li><li><p>women (49.5±29.5?nmol/l) (p=0.009).</p></li></ul><p>No association was demonstrated with age, aetiology of IF, or ethnicity.</p><p>There was a trend towards reduced Vitamin D and increasing BMI (p=0.187, r2=0.028).</p><p>No seasonal variation was demonstrated between summer (June–November, 42.8±26.5?nmol/l) and winter (December–May, 39.3±21.6?nmol/l) (p=0.57).</p><p>Only 26% (n=22) of patients had repeat vitamin D concentrations before discharge. There was a significant increase in vitamin D concentrations from 35±22?nmol/l to 44.8±14.3?nmol/l, (p=0.03).</p><p>Twenty-nine patients received <strong>intramuscular Vitamin D at a dose of 300?000?IU</strong> . In these patients there was an increase in concentration before (28.4±13.6?nmol/l) and after (42.8±12.7?nmol/l). Due to the small numbers of patients it was not possible to determine the efficacy of the different vitamin D preparations or the effect of the multivitamin preparation used in parenteral nutrition (Cernevit®) on serum concentrations.</p><p>Conclusion Vitamin D deficiency is common and occurs in three-quarters of IF patients. Male gender was associated with lower concentrations. Robust policies need to be in place for the identification of vitamin D deficiency including the supplementation and monitoring of vitamin D deficiency in patients with IF to ensure adequate serum concentrations are achieved.</p><p>Competing interests None declared.</p><p>References 1.

Are we measuring vitamin D in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients?</h4><p>Inflammatory bowel disease III</p><p>S K Butt, K Besherdas</p><p>Department of Gastroenterology, Chase Farm Hospital, London, UK</p><p>Introduction There is increasing interest in the role of vitamin D in IBD, outside of its traditional role in metabolic bone disease. Novel insights into additional roles for vitamin D are being established and these include anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating effects. Active vitamin D is known to exert its biological functions via the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Immune cells have been found to express VDR and possess the enzymes necessary to produce active vitamin D. This suggests vitamin D may have actions beyond endocrine activity. Furthermore, Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to higher rates of cancers including colorectal cancer.</p><p>Previous studies have found that almost 50% of the IBD patients were vitamin D deficient at some point and 11% were severely deficient.</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency has been demonstrated to be independently associated with higher disease activity scores in patients compared to those that had normal levels of vitamin D. Furthermore, <strong>vitamin D deficient Crohn&rsquo;s patients have a poorer quality of life when compared to patients who are not vitamin D deficient</strong> . Currently, ECCO guidelines do not mention measurement of vitamin D in patients with IBD but given its effects, we set out to identify whether we were checking for and correcting for vitamin D deficiency in our IBD patients.</p><p>Methods The aim of the study was to investigate whether we were measuring vitamin D levels at any encounter in out IBD patients. This study was conducted in a busy District General Hospital in North London. Information was gathered using the hospital powerchart system and the IBD database of patients.</p><p>Results A total of 225 patients were correctly identified as having IBD. Of these,</p><ul><li><p>157 (70%) had Ulcerative colitis and</p></li><li><p>68 (30%) had Crohn&rsquo;s disease. 2</p></li></ul><p>(4 (15%) Ulcerative colitis patients and</p><ul><li>8 (12%) Crohn&rsquo;s patients</li></ul><p>had their vitamin D checked on hospital records.</p><p>The range of vitamin D levels were 14–84 with lower limit of normal being 50. 13/32 (41%) patients has low vitamin D levels Of these only two patients were also under the Rheumatology team for co-existing arthropathy/arthritis.</p><p>Conclusion This study demonstrates that despite evidence of Vitamin D and its role in anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating effects (in addition to bone protection) we are not actively measuring and treating its deficiency. Perhaps guidance from ECCO may encourage our testing of vitamin D in IBD patients.</p><p>Competing interests None declared.</p><p><strong>(Summary: 41% had less than 20 nanograms of vitamin D yet ECCO {?} still not even recommend vitamin D testing, much less treatment)</strong></p><hr><h4 id=pwe-241-vitamin-d-status-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease-are-clinicians-seeing-the-light>PWE-241?

Marshall</p><p>Received 2 August 2011; received in revised form 4 October 2011; accepted 30 October 2011. published online 28 November 2011.</p><p>A relationship between vitamin D and several disorders, including Crohn&rsquo;s disease (CD), has recently been proposed. Vitamin D appears to have several important actions beyond the maintenance of bone health, including various effects on the immune system. Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in the development of CD, and its analogues may have a role in the treatment of CD. Current research also suggests a role for vitamin D in counteracting some IBD-specific complications, including osteopenia, colorectal neoplasia, and depression. There remains a need for prospective studies to further delineate these relationships. Given current evidence and the apparent safety of vitamin D supplementation, it appears reasonable to screen for and treat vitamin D deficiency in patients with IBD.</p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-crohns-disease-prevalence-risk-factors-and-supplement-use-in-an-outpatient-setting>Vitamin D deficiency in Crohn&rsquo;s disease: Prevalence, risk factors and supplement use in an outpatient setting</h4><p>Journal of Crohn&rsquo;s and Colitis, Volume 6, Issue 2 , Pages 182-188, March 2012</p><p>Treasa Nic Suibhne, Gerry Cox, Martin Healy, Colm O&rsquo;Morain, Maria O&rsquo;Sullivan</p><p>Received 26 May 2011; received in revised form 10 August 2011; accepted 11 August 2011. published online 26 September 2011.</p><p>Background and aims</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency impacts on bone health and has potential new roles in inflammation. We aimed to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for vitamin D deficiency and to explore vitamin D supplement usage in patients with Crohn&rsquo;s disease (CD) in an outpatient setting, compared with controls.</p><p>Methods</p><p>Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay in 151 participants, comprising 81 CD patients and 70 age-, sex- and socio-economic status-matched healthy controls. Levels of 25(OH)D &lt;50nmol/L were classed as deficient. Data on vitamin supplement usage were recorded for all participants at interview.</p><p>Results</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency was common in patients with CD (63%) and significantly higher in winter than summer (68% v 50%; p&lt;0.001, ?2). Notably, the deficiency rate remained high even in summer (50%). On regression analysis, 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with winter season. Disease-specific factors for lower serum 25(OH)D levels were longer disease duration and smoking. Overall, 43% of patients reported using a vitamin D-containing supplement, primarily at low dosages (200–400IU/d); however, this level of supplement did not prevent deficiency. For the majority of CD patients, 25(OH)D remained below optimal levels proposed to confer bone and immune health benefits.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency was common in patients with CD and associated with longstanding disease, smoking and winter. While over 40% of patients used a vitamin D-containing supplement, the dosages were inadequate to prevent deficiency. Appropriate vitamin D screening and supplementation should be considered in the context of health promotion of outpatients with CD.</p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-as-a-therapy-for-colitis-a-systematic-review>Vitamin D as a therapy for colitis: A systematic review</h4><p>Imogen Nicholson, A.

Both human and animal studies published in English language were examined. The reference lists of included studies and review articles were manually searched for any relevant studies.</p><p>Results</p><p>Four studies were included in this systematic review. All reported an improvement in disease activity with vitamin D supplementation. The only high quality human study reported a non-significant reduction of relapse rate for Crohn&rsquo;s disease. No major adverse effects of vitamin D supplementation were reported.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Although there is some evidence that supplemental vitamin D, as an adjunctive treatment, may help in controlling colitis, this evidence is not enough to justify using vitamin D in treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Large high quality placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials are needed to explore a possible benefit of using vitamin D in treating IBD.</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/blood-levels.html><span class=tag>blood levels</span></a>
