#### Interaction between Fokl polymorphism and vitamin D deficiency in the symptoms of mental disorders in adults: a population-based study

Sci Rep. 2024 Mar 22;14(1):6925. [doi: 10.1038/s41598-024-57558-1.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-57558-1.)

Caption: The variable in green and with the “►” symbol was the exposure variable; in blue and with the letter “I” was the response variables; variables in blue are the antecedents of the outcome variable; and those in red are antecedents of the outcome and exposure variables;the variable in gray is a collider and indicates a closed or blocked path.

Mental disorders are intricate and multifaceted and encompass social, economic, environmental, and biological factors. This study aimed to explore the potential association between vitamin D deficiency and anxiety and depression symptoms in adults, considering the role of the vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism FokI (rs2228570). This was a population-based cross-sectional study with stratified and cluster sampling, evaluating anxiety symptoms (AS) and depression symptoms (DS) in 1637 adults. Vitamin D levels were measured using electrochemiluminescence and were considered deficient when < 20 ng/mL in a healthy population or < 30 ng/mL in at-risk groups. Genotyping was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction with TaqMan probes. The prevalence rates of AS, DS, and vitamin D deficiency were 23.5%, 15.8%, and 30.9%, respectively. No direct association was observed between vitamin D deficiency and AS or DS. However, interaction analysis revealed a combined effect of vitamin D deficiency and FokI for DS but not for AS. Individuals with vitamin deficiency and one or two copies of the altered allele of the FokI exhibited a higher prevalence of DS than individuals homozygous for the wild-type allele and vitamin D sufficiency. The interaction between vitamin D deficiency and the FokI polymorphism was associated with DS.

!!!!Interaction between Fokl polymorphism and vitamin D deficiency in the symptoms of mental disorders in adults: a population-based study

Caption: The variable in green and with the “►” symbol was the exposure variable; in blue and with the letter “I” was the response variables; variables in blue are the antecedents of the outcome variable; and those in red are antecedents of the outcome and exposure variables;the variable in gray is a collider and indicates a closed or blocked path.

Mental disorders are intricate and multifaceted and encompass social, economic, environmental, and biological factors. This study aimed to explore the potential association between vitamin D deficiency and anxiety and depression symptoms in adults, considering the role of the vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism FokI (rs2228570). This was a population-based cross-sectional study with stratified and cluster sampling, evaluating anxiety symptoms (AS) and depression symptoms (DS) in 1637 adults. Vitamin D levels were measured using electrochemiluminescence and were considered deficient when &lt; 20 ng/mL in a healthy population or &lt; 30 ng/mL in at-risk groups. Genotyping was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction with TaqMan probes. The prevalence rates of AS, DS, and vitamin D deficiency were 23.5%, 15.8%, and 30.9%, respectively. No direct association was observed between vitamin D deficiency and AS or DS. However, interaction analysis revealed a combined effect of vitamin D deficiency and FokI for DS but not for AS. Individuals with vitamin deficiency and one or two copies of the altered allele of the FokI exhibited a higher prevalence of DS than individuals homozygous for the wild-type allele and vitamin D sufficiency. The interaction between vitamin D deficiency and the FokI polymorphism was associated with DS.
