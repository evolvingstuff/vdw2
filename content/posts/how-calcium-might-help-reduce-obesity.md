# Review: Postprandial Energy Metabolism in the Regulation of Body Weight: Is there a Mechanistic Role for Dietary Calcium?

Mario J. Soares and Wendy L. Chan She-Ping-Delfos  

Nutrients 2010, 2(6), 586-598; doi:10.3390/nu2060586  Received: 16 April 2010; in revised form: 26 May 2010 / Accepted: 27 May 2010 / Published: 28 May 2010 

Abstract: There has been much interest in the mechanisms by which calcium may attenuate weight gain or accelerate body fat loss. This review focuses on postprandial energy metabolism and indicates that dietary calcium increases whole body fat oxidation after single and multiple meals. There is, as yet, no conclusive evidence for a greater diet induced thermogenesis, an increased lipolysis or suppression of key lipogenic enzyme systems. There is however convincing evidence that higher calcium intakes promote a modest energy loss through increased fecal fat excretion. Overall, there is a role for dietary calcium in human energy metabolism. Future studies need to define threshold intakes for metabolic and gastrointestinal outcomes.
