Background/Objectives: Vitamin D is essential for bone health, immune function, and overall well-being. Numerous ecological, observational, and prospective studies, including randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), report an inverse association between higher serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span&gt;[25(OH)D; calcifediol]&lt;/span&gt; levels in various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity, susceptibility to infection-related complications, autoimmune diseases, and all-cause mortality. 

Results: Vitamin D operates through two distinct systems. The endocrine system comprises the renal tubular cell-derived circulatory calcitriol, which primarily regulates calcium homeostasis and muscular functions. In contrast, intracellularly generated calcitriol in peripheral target cells is responsible for intracrine/paracrine system signaling and calcitriol-vitamin D receptor-mediated genomic effects. Government- appointed committees and health organizations have developed various clinical practice guidelines for vitamin D supplementation and management.  **However, these guidelines heavily relied on the 2011 Institute of Medicine (IoM) report, which focused solely on the skeletal effects of vitamin D, ignoring other body systems.**  Thus, they do not represent maintaining good overall health and aspects of disease prevention. Additionally, the IoM report was intended as a public health recommendation for the government and is not a clinical guideline. Discussion: New country- and regional-specific guidelines must focus on healthy nations through disease prevention and reducing healthcare costs. They should not be restricted to bone effect and must encompass all extra-skeletal benefits. . 

Nevertheless, due to misunderstandings, medical societies and other governments have used faulty IoM report as a foundation for creating vitamin D guidelines. Consequently, they placed disproportionate emphasis on bone health while largely overlooking its benefits for other bodily systems, making current guidelines, including 2024, the Endocrine Society less applicable to the public. As a result, the utility of published guidelines has been significantly reduced for clinical practice and RCTs that designed on bone-centric are generate misleading information and remain suboptimal for public health and disease prevention. 

Conclusions: This review and its recommendations address the gaps in current vitamin D clinical practice guidelines and propose a framework for developing more effective, country and region-specific recommendations that capture the extra-skeletal benefits of vitamin D to prevent multiple diseases and enhance public health.

Background/Objectives: Vitamin D is essential for bone health, immune function, and overall well-being. Numerous ecological, observational, and prospective studies, including randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), report an inverse association between higher serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D; calcifediol] levels in various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity, susceptibility to infection-related complications, autoimmune diseases, and all-cause mortality. 

Results: Vitamin D operates through two distinct systems. The endocrine system comprises the renal tubular cell-derived circulatory calcitriol, which primarily regulates calcium homeostasis and muscular functions. In contrast, intracellularly generated calcitriol in peripheral target cells is responsible for intracrine/paracrine system signaling and calcitriol-vitamin D receptor-mediated genomic effects. Government- appointed committees and health organizations have developed various clinical practice guidelines for vitamin D supplementation and management. __However, these guidelines heavily relied on the 2011 Institute of Medicine (IoM) report, which focused solely on the skeletal effects of vitamin D, ignoring other body systems.__ Thus, they do not represent maintaining good overall health and aspects of disease prevention. Additionally, the IoM report was intended as a public health recommendation for the government and is not a clinical guideline. Discussion: New country- and regional-specific guidelines must focus on healthy nations through disease prevention and reducing healthcare costs. They should not be restricted to bone effect and must encompass all extra-skeletal benefits. . 
Nevertheless, due to misunderstandings, medical societies and other governments have used faulty IoM report as a foundation for creating vitamin D guidelines. Consequently, they placed disproportionate emphasis on bone health while largely overlooking its benefits for other bodily systems, making current guidelines, including 2024, the Endocrine Society less applicable to the public. As a result, the utility of published guidelines has been significantly reduced for clinical practice and RCTs that designed on bone-centric are generate misleading information and remain suboptimal for public health and disease prevention. 

Conclusions: This review and its recommendations address the gaps in current vitamin D clinical practice guidelines and propose a framework for developing more effective, country and region-specific recommendations that capture the extra-skeletal benefits of vitamin D to prevent multiple diseases and enhance public health.
