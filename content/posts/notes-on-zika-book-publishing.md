> Try a different English sentence and use Google translate to check the revised sentence translation

* Online book + Google translate to Portuguese/Spanish ==> MS Word P/S

> Human editors clean-up the translation

> Replace English Graphics with Portuguese/Spanish Graphics

> Priced as low as Amazon allows: probably $1.99 ( $0.99 seems to cheap)

> PDF versions would be on web

> &nbsp; &nbsp; PDF in P/S would have human aided translations and language appropriate graphics

> Online version would be in 103 languages  - for free 

> - but would lack human-aided translation and would only have English graphics

> Accessibility features of both Kindle and online versions (but not PDF?)

> &nbsp; &nbsp; Change font size, font type (Dyslexic etc), high-contrast, 

> Paper version available on demand from Amazon (US only?)
