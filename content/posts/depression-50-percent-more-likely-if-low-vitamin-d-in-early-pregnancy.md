Objective To examine low maternal vitamin D status as a potential risk factor for high levels of depressive symptoms in a pregnant population.

Methods In the Amsterdam Born Children and Their Development cohort, maternal serum vitamin D (n = 4236) was measured during early pregnancy (median, 13 weeks) and labeled “deficient” (?29.9 nM), “insufficient” (30–49.9 nM), “sufficient” (50–79.9 nM), and “normal” (?80 nM). Maternal depressive symptoms were measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale at 16-week gestation. The association of vitamin D status with high levels of depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression score ?16) was assessed by multivariate logistic regression (final sample, 4101).

Results Overall, 23% of women had vitamin D deficiency, and 21% of women had vitamin D insufficiency. Women with high levels of depressive symptoms (28%) had lower vitamin D concentrations than women with low levels of depressive symptoms (p < .001). 

After adjustment for constitutional factors, life-style and psychosocial covariates, and sociodemographic factors, vitamin D deficiency (odds ratio <span>[OR]</span>, 1.48; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>, 1.13–1.95) and insufficiency (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.12–1.85) were significantly associated with high levels of depressive symptoms. 

Additional analyses revealed a linear trend, with an OR of 1.05 (95% CI, 1.02–1.08) for each 10-nM decrease in vitamin D status.

Conclusions In this study, low early-pregnancy vitamin D status was associated with elevated depressive symptoms in pregnancy. Further research, using a randomized controlled design, would be required to confirm the causality of this association and the potential benefits of higher vitamin D intake for psychosocial health.
