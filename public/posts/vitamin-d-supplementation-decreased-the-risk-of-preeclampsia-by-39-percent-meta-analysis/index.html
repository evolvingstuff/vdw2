<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The results of previous studies regarding the effect of vitamin D on the incidence of preeclampsia are inconsistent. Therefore, the primary objective of the present review was to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on the risk of preeclampsia.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Five major scientific databases were searched from inception to June 10, 2023. Studies with randomized controlled trial designs were identified. To assess the methodological quality of the selected studies, the Cochrane Tool Checklist (CTC) was used. The random effect model was chosen as a combination model.

Effect size indicators including risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), and number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated with estimated 95 % confidence intervals.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Nineteen studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled RR of preeclampsia in the intervention group compared to the control group was 0.61 (95 % CI, 0.47 to 0.78; I2=14.4 %; Ï‡2=23.37; p = 0.27; tau2=0.05), and indicated a  <strong>39 % reduction in the risk of preeclampsia.</strong>  The pooled RD of preeclampsia in the intervention group compared to the control group was -0.03 (95 % CI: -0.05 to -0.01; I2=45.5 %; Ï‡2=36.68; p = 0.01; tau2=0.0008) and the difference in the risk of preeclampsia among women who received vitamin D supplements was 3 % less than the control group.  <strong>The NNT was 29</strong>  (95 % CI: 20 to 52).</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Vitamin D supplementation significantly reduces preeclampsia during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Preeclampsia is one of the most important challenges in midwifery. The disorder is defined based on increased blood pressure and newly started proteinuria after the 20th week of pregnancy. In the absence of proteinuria, high blood pressure with evidence of systemic disease (such as thrombocytopenia or elevated liver transaminases) is also suggestive of preeclampsia <sup>[1,2]</sup>. In total, preeclampsia and its complications are responsible for 63,000 maternal deaths worldwide each year, accounting for 12 % of all maternal deaths <sup>[2]</sup>. The disorder affects 3 %âˆ’5 % of pregnancies worldwide <sup>[1]</sup>, <sup>[2]</sup>, <sup>[3]</sup>. The incidence of the disorder in developed countries is approximately 3.4 %, and in developing countries it ranges from 1.8 % to 16.7 % <sup>[4]</sup>. Differences in incidence among countries reflect, at least in part, differences in maternal age distribution and the proportion of primiparous pregnant mothers in that country&rsquo;s population <sup>[3]</sup>.</p>
<p>Preeclampsia is a multisystem disease with adverse short-term and long-term consequences for both mother and fetus <sup>[3]</sup>. Pregnant women with pre-eclampsia are prone to pulmonary edema, coagulation defects, and kidney failure in the current pregnancy, as well as being at greater risk of increased blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases in the later stages of life <sup>[5]</sup>. Fetal consequences of preeclampsia include intrauterine growth restriction and oligohydramnios, as well as increasing the need to terminate the pregnancy in the form of premature birth, which increases perinatal complications and mortality (3). The greatest risk is in pregnancies with the onset of preeclampsia before the 34th week of pregnancy <sup>[3]</sup>.</p>
<p>Various hypotheses have been proposed for the etiology of preeclampsia. Placental dysfunction is accepted as the main cause of preeclampsia because the definitive treatment for preeclampsia is delivery. Placental hypoxia, oxidative stress, vascular endothelial dysfunction, immunity, and genetic factors also contribute to placental dysfunction and vascular abnormalities, which are thought to be the main cause of preeclampsia <sup>[6]</sup>. Among women at high risk of preeclampsia, an inverse relationship between maternal vitamin D levels in the second trimester and the risk of early preeclampsia has been observed <sup>[7,8]</sup>. Taking cholecalciferol (vitamin D) supplements can increase glutathione levels and reduce the production of lipid peroxidation products, leading to a reduction in oxidative stress. Therefore, it is possible that early supplements with a high dose of cholecalciferol can be useful in reducing oxidative stress biomarkers as well as improving vascular endothelial function and preventing the occurrence of preeclampsia <sup>[9]</sup>.</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship between the serum level of vitamin D and the occurrence of preeclampsia, a few systematic review and meta-analysis studies have summarized the available evidence from interventional studies on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the chances of preeclampsia using the odds ratio (OR) <sup>[10,11]</sup>. In Gallo et al.â€™s study, the chance of preeclampsia was reduced by 30 % but was not statistically significant <sup>[11]</sup>. In 2020, Fogacci et al. (10) also found an OR equal to 0.37. Although this was statistically significant, some of the studies included in this meta-analysis were later retracted, Furthermore, in this meta-analysis, the appropriate effect size indices for interventional studies such as RR or RD were not calculated, and only the odds ratios (ORs) were reported. Given that ORs always exaggerate the size of the effect compared to relative risk <sup>[12]</sup>, the results are not reliable. Lo and Lo updated Fogacci et al. study in 2022 and they excluded some studies that were retracted or whose data were not properly extracted, and one study that was found in the manual search was added to the meta-analysis <sup>[13]</sup>. Therefore, the aim of the present review was to conduct the meta-analysis more accurately. The present review included three studies published in 2021 <sup>[14]</sup>, <sup>[15]</sup>, <sup>[16]</sup> in the meta-analysis as well as correctly extracting the data of the Sablok et al. <sup>[17]</sup> study which was excluded from the meta-analysis by Lo and Lo. The RD and NNT were also calculated, in addition to the risk ratio (RR) so that readers can better interpret the results. In other reviews, where the results were analyzed using the RR, two studies reported a reduction in the risk of preeclampsia by 9 % <sup>[18]</sup> and 53 % <sup>[4]</sup>, and one study also reported a slight increase in the risk of preeclampsia <sup>[19]</sup>.</p>
<p>Due to the explanations given above, and the inconsistent results of previous studies, there is a need to re-conduct a meta-analysis study with a comprehensive and up-to-date search in academic databases, as well as performing analyses using appropriate effect size indicators. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis were designed with the main goal of investigating the effect of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on the risk of preeclampsia.</p>

 **Highlights** 

* Vitamin D may be beneficial in preventing the occurrence of preeclampsia.

* Studies have yielded inconsistent results about the benefits of vitamin D for preeclampsia.

* A new meta-analysis was needed to include recent studies.

* The meta-analysis assessed vitamin D&#39;s impact on preeclampsia risk during pregnancy.

* Vitamin D supplementation reduces the incidence of preeclampsia.

Introduction

The results of previous studies regarding the effect of vitamin D on the incidence of preeclampsia are inconsistent. Therefore, the primary objective of the present review was to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on the risk of preeclampsia.

Methods

Five major scientific databases were searched from inception to June 10, 2023. Studies with randomized controlled trial designs were identified. To assess the methodological quality of the selected studies, the Cochrane Tool Checklist (CTC) was used. The random effect model was chosen as a combination model. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using the standard Ï‡2 test, and the intensity of heterogeneity was calculated using I2. Effect size indicators including risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), and number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated with estimated 95 % confidence intervals.

Results

Nineteen studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled RR of preeclampsia in the intervention group compared to the control group was 0.61 (95 % CI, 0.47 to 0.78; I2=14.4 %; Ï‡2=23.37; p = 0.27; tau2=0.05), and indicated a  **39 % reduction in the risk of preeclampsia.**  The pooled RD of preeclampsia in the intervention group compared to the control group was -0.03 (95 % CI: -0.05 to -0.01; I2=45.5 %; Ï‡2=36.68; p = 0.01; tau2=0.0008) and the difference in the risk of preeclampsia among women who received vitamin D supplements was 3 % less than the control group.  **The NNT was 29**  (95 % CI: 20 to 52).

__Highlights__
*Vitamin D may be beneficial in preventing the occurrence of preeclampsia.
*Studies have yielded inconsistent results about the benefits of vitamin D for preeclampsia.
*A new meta-analysis was needed to include recent studies.
*The meta-analysis assessed vitamin D&#39;s impact on preeclampsia risk during pregnancy.
*Vitamin D supplementation reduces the incidence of preeclampsia.
Introduction
The results of previous studies regarding the effect of vitamin D on the incidence of preeclampsia are inconsistent. Therefore, the primary objective of the present review was to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on the risk of preeclampsia.

Methods
Five major scientific databases were searched from inception to June 10, 2023. Studies with randomized controlled trial designs were identified. To assess the methodological quality of the selected studies, the Cochrane Tool Checklist (CTC) was used. The random effect model was chosen as a combination model. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using the standard Ï‡2 test, and the intensity of heterogeneity was calculated using I2. Effect size indicators including risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), and number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated with estimated 95 % confidence intervals.

Results
Nineteen studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled RR of preeclampsia in the intervention group compared to the control group was 0.61 (95 % CI, 0.47 to 0.78; I2=14.4 %; Ï‡2=23.37; p = 0.27; tau2=0.05), and indicated a __39 % reduction in the risk of preeclampsia.__ The pooled RD of preeclampsia in the intervention group compared to the control group was -0.03 (95 % CI: -0.05 to -0.01; I2=45.5 %; Ï‡2=36.68; p = 0.01; tau2=0.0008) and the difference in the risk of preeclampsia among women who received vitamin D supplements was 3 % less than the control group. __The NNT was 29__ (95 % CI: 20 to 52).

Conclusion
Vitamin D supplementation significantly reduces preeclampsia during pregnancy.

Introduction
Preeclampsia is one of the most important challenges in midwifery. The disorder is defined based on increased blood pressure and newly started proteinuria after the 20th week of pregnancy. In the absence of proteinuria, high blood pressure with evidence of systemic disease (such as thrombocytopenia or elevated liver transaminases) is also suggestive of preeclampsia [1,2]. In total, preeclampsia and its complications are responsible for 63,000 maternal deaths worldwide each year, accounting for 12 % of all maternal deaths [2]. The disorder affects 3 %âˆ’5 % of pregnancies worldwide [1], [2], [3]. The incidence of the disorder in developed countries is approximately 3.4 %, and in developing countries it ranges from 1.8 % to 16.7 % [4]. Differences in incidence among countries reflect, at least in part, differences in maternal age distribution and the proportion of primiparous pregnant mothers in that country&#39;s population [3].

Preeclampsia is a multisystem disease with adverse short-term and long-term consequences for both mother and fetus [3]. Pregnant women with pre-eclampsia are prone to pulmonary edema, coagulation defects, and kidney failure in the current pregnancy, as well as being at greater risk of increased blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases in the later stages of life [5]. Fetal consequences of preeclampsia include intrauterine growth restriction and oligohydramnios, as well as increasing the need to terminate the pregnancy in the form of premature birth, which increases perinatal complications and mortality (3). The greatest risk is in pregnancies with the onset of preeclampsia before the 34th week of pregnancy [3].

Various hypotheses have been proposed for the etiology of preeclampsia. Placental dysfunction is accepted as the main cause of preeclampsia because the definitive treatment for preeclampsia is delivery. Placental hypoxia, oxidative stress, vascular endothelial dysfunction, immunity, and genetic factors also contribute to placental dysfunction and vascular abnormalities, which are thought to be the main cause of preeclampsia [6]. Among women at high risk of preeclampsia, an inverse relationship between maternal vitamin D levels in the second trimester and the risk of early preeclampsia has been observed [7,8]. Taking cholecalciferol (vitamin D) supplements can increase glutathione levels and reduce the production of lipid peroxidation products, leading to a reduction in oxidative stress. Therefore, it is possible that early supplements with a high dose of cholecalciferol can be useful in reducing oxidative stress biomarkers as well as improving vascular endothelial function and preventing the occurrence of preeclampsia [9].

Regarding the relationship between the serum level of vitamin D and the occurrence of preeclampsia, a few systematic review and meta-analysis studies have summarized the available evidence from interventional studies on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the chances of preeclampsia using the odds ratio (OR) [10,11]. In Gallo et al.â€™s study, the chance of preeclampsia was reduced by 30 % but was not statistically significant [11]. In 2020, Fogacci et al. (10) also found an OR equal to 0.37. Although this was statistically significant, some of the studies included in this meta-analysis were later retracted, Furthermore, in this meta-analysis, the appropriate effect size indices for interventional studies such as RR or RD were not calculated, and only the odds ratios (ORs) were reported. Given that ORs always exaggerate the size of the effect compared to relative risk [12], the results are not reliable. Lo and Lo updated Fogacci et al. study in 2022 and they excluded some studies that were retracted or whose data were not properly extracted, and one study that was found in the manual search was added to the meta-analysis [13]. Therefore, the aim of the present review was to conduct the meta-analysis more accurately. The present review included three studies published in 2021 [14], [15], [16] in the meta-analysis as well as correctly extracting the data of the Sablok et al. [17] study which was excluded from the meta-analysis by Lo and Lo. The RD and NNT were also calculated, in addition to the risk ratio (RR) so that readers can better interpret the results. In other reviews, where the results were analyzed using the RR, two studies reported a reduction in the risk of preeclampsia by 9 % [18] and 53 % [4], and one study also reported a slight increase in the risk of preeclampsia [19].

Due to the explanations given above, and the inconsistent results of previous studies, there is a need to re-conduct a meta-analysis study with a comprehensive and up-to-date search in academic databases, as well as performing analyses using appropriate effect size indicators. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis were designed with the main goal of investigating the effect of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on the risk of preeclampsia.

__Section snippets__
Methods
The present review was designed based on the stages of systematic reviews using the guidelines for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-aAnalyses (PRISMA) [20].

Study selection
The search process led to the retrieval of 1464 potentially relevant papers. Among these papers, 209 papers were removed due to duplication. Then, the title and abstract were checked and 1232 irrelevant papers were removed (such as being non-intervention studies, animal studies, not containing empirical data, and/or not meeting the requirements of the inclusion criteria). Finally, the full text of the remaining 23 papers was studied, of which five were excluded from the analysis due to notÂ .Â .Â . 

Principle findings
The present review was conducted to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on the incidence of preeclampsia. For this purpose, both risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) indices were examined. Over half of the studies included in the present meta-analysis were conducted in Iran, and except for two studies that were conducted in Ukraine and America, the rest of the studies were conducted in Asian countries. One of the reasons for more studies in Iran may be theÂ .Â .Â . 

Conclusions
The quality of evidence, based on GRADE ratings, was found to be high in the case of the pooled RR and moderate in the case of the pooled RD. Based on all the studies reviewed, Vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced preeclampsia during pregnancy. More specifically, the pooled RR and RD of preeclampsia in the intervention group compared to the control group were both significant. Moreover, due to the aforementioned limitations, it would be useful to design high-quality interventionalÂ .Â .Â .
