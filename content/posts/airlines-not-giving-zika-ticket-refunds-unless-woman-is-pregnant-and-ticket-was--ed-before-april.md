* "United, Delta, and Alaska Airlines all said there is no one-size-fits-all policy."

#### [American Airlines Policy](https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/special-assistance/traveling-children.jsp)

* "If you're pregnant and traveling to a destination in Latin America or the Caribbean affected by the Zika virus, you and your travel companions can request a refund for tickets purchased on or before March 31, 2016. Just provide a doctor's note confirming your pregnancy when you request a refund."

> AA will, however, allow them to change their tickets to a different destination for $200 each
