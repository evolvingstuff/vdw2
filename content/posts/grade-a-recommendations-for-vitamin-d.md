*  **Personal/social history**  of  inadequate sun exposure (e.g., working indoors, homebound, living in  higher latitude, wearing excessive clothing, dark skinned and use of sun  block) and insufficient dietary intake of vitamin D fortified foods   **(<span style="color:#090;">Grade A</span>, Evidence Good)**

*  **Nutritional deficiency (25OHD <20 ng/ml (<span style="color:#090;">Grade A</span>, Evidence Good)**   requires initial treatment with 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 or D3 orally once per week for six to eight weeks (may take longer depending on starting 25OHD level), and then 800 to 1000 IU of vitamin D3 daily thereafter 

   * (Dawson-Hughes, 2008; Lyman, 2005; Holick, 2007). 

   * Intramuscular cholecalciferol (300,000 U) in one or two doses per year is also an option for increasing serum 25OHD levels (de Torrente de la Jara, Pecoud, & Favrat, 2006) 

*  **Obesity, metabolic  syndromes, and type II diabetes (<span style="color:#00F;">Grade B</span>, Evidence Fair)**  

   * (Holick, 2007; Giovannucci et al., 2008;  Cannell &amp; Hollis, 2008; Konradsen et al., 2008; Rodriguez-Rodriguez  et al., 2009; Pittas et al., 2007; Mattila et al., 2007; Melamed et  al., 2008)

 **Grading of Recommendations** (Based on  U.S. Preventive Services Task Force <span>[USPSTF]</span> Ratings)

* ~~#090:A. The USPSTF strongly recommends  that clinicians provide the service to eligible patients. 

> The USPSTF  found good evidence that the service improves important health outcomes  and CONCLUDES THAT BENEFITS OUTWEIGH HARMS.~~

* ~~#00F:B. The USPSTF recommends that  clinicians provide this service to eligible patients. 

> The USPSTF found  at least fair evidence that the service improves important health  outcomes and CONCLUDE THAT BENEFITS OUTWEIGH HARMS~~.

 **Quality of Evidence**  (Based on U.S. Preventive Services Task Force <span>[USPSTF]</span> Ratings)

*  **Good** : Evidence includes consistent  results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative  populations that directly assess effects on health outcomes.

*  **Fair** : Evidence is sufficient to  determine effects on health outcomes, but the strength of the evidence  is limited by the number, quality, or consistency of the individual  studies, generalizability to routine practice, or indirect nature of the  evidence of health outcomes.

## The evidence has gotten much stronger since 2008 when this report was made, and much higher doses are now being used
