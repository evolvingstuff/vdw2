Background

Vitamin D deficiency is an important health concern because it is related to several comorbidities and mortality. However, its relationship with the risk of hematuria remains undetermined in the general population. In this study, we analyzed the association between vitamin D deficiency and hematuria.

Methods

We conducted cross-sectional analysis using data of participants from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2010–2014. A total of 20,240 participants, aged ≥18 years old, were analyzed. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels were measured in a central laboratory and hematuria was defined as ≥1+ on a dipstick test. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of hematuria risk according to serum 25(OH)D quartiles, after adjusting several covariates.

Results

A total 3144 (15.5%) participants had hematuria. The mean 25(OH)D level was 17.4 ± 6.2 ng/mL (median, 16.6 ng/mL (interquartile range, 13.1–20.8 ng/mL)). The 3rd and 4th quartiles had a higher risk of hematuria than the 1st quartile, with adjusted ORs 1.26 (1.114–1.415) and 1.40 (1.240–1.572) in the 3rd and 4th quartiles, respectively. However, this relationship was only significant in women, not in men. When stratified analyses were conducted according to menopausal status, there was a significant increase of hematuria risk according to quartiles in postmenopausal but not in premenopausal women.

Conclusion

We found that vitamin D deficiency is correlated with hematuria in women, particularly after menopause. Further interventional studies are warranted to address whether correcting vitamin D deficiency can lower the risk of hematuria.
