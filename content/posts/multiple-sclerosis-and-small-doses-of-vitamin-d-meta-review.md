* They consider >1,000 IU to be “high dose”

* For MS high dose should be 20X higher

1. More than one nutrient is used by Dr. Coimbra 

1. Dose size varies with the patient (not one size fits all)

1. No randomized controlled trials for Dr. Coimbra – all patients are treated, not just half

* They thus gnore the success at CURING > 1,000 MS patients by Dr. Coimbra with Vitamin D, etc.

> The words Coimbra or Brazil do not occur even once in the meta-review

 **Question** 

* What is the clinical effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of multiple sclerosis?

* What is the clinical effectiveness of high versus low dose vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of multiple sclerosis?

* What is the clinical effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of multiple sclerosis?

* What is the clinical effectiveness of high versus low dose vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of multiple sclerosis?

 **Key Message** 

* Four systematic reviews, 

* eight randomized controlled trials, and 

* three non-randomized studies 

were identified regarding the clinical effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention or treatment of multiple sclerosis. Due to substantial heterogeneity between studies, the evidence for most clinical outcomes was limited and often conflicting. Very limited evidence suggests a potential benefit of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of MS, but this needs to be verified by future studies. Results of treatment of MS with vitamin D were inconsistent, with most evidence suggesting no effect on disability scores, and relapse rates. There were both positive and negative results for immunologic factors, imaging studies, and functional outcomes. Safety data suggests that high dose vitamin D is well tolerated and associated with minimal risk.
