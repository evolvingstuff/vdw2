### Have four 50,000 IU capsules in a blister pack

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/four-50k-iu.jpg" alt="image" width="400">

<!-- ~tc~ As the virus seems to be ever encroaching on our St. Herman's family, Henry and I would like (again) to provide free Vitamin D to all parishioners who want it. We are not doctors, so we cannot recommend for or against it. But you may choose to take Vitamin D as an alternative to the vaccine, or in addition to reducing side effects and as an additional preventative against colds and flu as well.

I am leaving a box of "emergency" 4-cap packets in the Parish Hall  You may take a packet for yourself and more as needed for your family.  Each adult should take all 4 caps in the packet right away if you experience Covid symptoms, or as a preventive over several days to build your immune system against Covid, flu, etc. Children should take less, obese adults more, according to body weight.

Taking a whole packet of four 50,000 IU caps may seem like a very high dose of Vitamin D, but the studies show that it is a safe amount for almost all adults, and that less probably won't be effective against the virus. Henry has been taking that amount every 4 days for the last 3 years, and many people (including me) have taken an even larger dose of Vitamin D at one time without ill effects. Complete information on dosage, safety, study results, etc., are to be found at is.gd/covidpt. We urge you to check it out.

We also have additional free Vitamin D for those who want prevention for longer than 3 weeks, just let me know. ~/tc~ -->

#### 1/2 the dose for children

 **Infants need about 1/4 of adult dose** 

#### 2X the dose for obese

### A weekly 50,000 IU tablespoon of Vitamin D water costs <1 cent

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/2-pennies.jpg" alt="image" width="200">

[Bulksupplements sells 100 grams of concentrated Vitamin D for $14 on Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/BulkSupplements-Vitamin-Cholecalciferol-Powder-Grams/dp/B00EV16SAA/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=bulk+supplements+vitamin+d&qid=1614858258&sr=8-9)

Also available on other Amazons, such as  [Australia](https://www.amazon.com.au/BulkSupplements-Vitamin-Cholecalciferol-Powder-Grams/dp/B00EV16SAA/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=bulksupplements+%22Vitamin+d%22&qid=1614860141&sr=8-3) 

50 milligrams of that powder contains 50,000 IU of Vitamin D

1.8 grams =1 level teaspoon = 1,800,000 IU of vitamin D = 50,000 IU for 30 person-weeks

&nbsp; &nbsp; which, when added to 1 pint of water will  provide 32 person weeks of Vitamin D

The water can be consumed directly once a week or added to juice, milk, etc

You should first restore your vitamin D levels initially by taking 4 tablespoons in one day

The follow-on weekly maintenance dose

| Adults | 1 tablespoon | 50,000 IU |
| Obese adults | 1 tablespoon | 100,000 IU |
| Children | 1/2 tablespoon | 25,000 IU |
| Infants  | 1/2 teaspoon | 8,000 IU |** Examples of how long 1 pint of Vitamin D water will last **| | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Weeks | consumers | Initial | Weekly maintenance |
| 5 weeks | 2 adults + 4 children: | 16 tablespoons | 4 tablespoons |
| 12 weeks | 2 adults | 8 tablespoons | 2 tablespoons |
| 4 weeks | 2 obese adults  | 16 tablespoons | 4 tablespoons |** Cost of Concentrate: $15 for 1760 person-weeks of 50,000IU **So; $15 of vitamin D concentrate provides 55 packets of contracted Vitamin D  100 gram / 1.8 gram

&nbsp; &nbsp; which provides 55 X 32 man-weeks = 1760 person weeks of 50,000 IU/week

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which is  17X lower cost than the cost of capsules in bottles   1760/100 capsules
