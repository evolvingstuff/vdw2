A few times a year a tiny portion of my back would seize up making movement and walking  painful

In April 2022 I purchased a  [$32 TENS machine from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NCRE4GO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

The next opportunity to use the TENS machine was in Jan 2023

Pain is almost entirely gone after ~ four 30-minute treatments in a single day

It has lots of options - but I only used the defaults on level 3 intensity out of 10
