 **Data as a table** 

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Jabs | % infection by<br> Omicron/other variants |
| 3 jabs | 7.96% |
| 2 jabs | 5.59% |
| 1 jab | 2.56% |
| 0 jab | 1.2% |

 **Thus:  
<span style="color:#F00;">8%</span> got Omicron instead of Delta for those with 3 jabs  
<span style="color:#F00;">2.5%</span> got Omicron instead of Delta for those with a single jab** 

 **However:   
Speculation 1) Most people with just a single jab were social distancing  
Speculation 2) Fewer people with 3 jabs were socially distancing  
&nbsp; &nbsp;  If both speculations 1&2 are correct, then people with 3 jabs would be more likely to get Omicron** 

#### The more COVID19 vaccine injections, the more omicron infections

Hervé Seligmann

The Danish Statens Serum Institut published on December 13 2021 the "COVID-19 rapport om Omikronvarianten". In Table 4 on page 6, it shows numbers of infections by omicron vs other variants in 4 vaccination categories, no injection, 1 injection, 2 injections, and 3 injections. Their graphical representation is below.

It is most likely that all vaccination categories have the same probability of exposure to omicron, yet risks of developing an infection as compared to other variants increase with numbers of injections. Omicron apparently has low virulence, which would enable the vaccinated to develop natural immunity at low risks despite vaccination. Natural immunity is for now more efficient and general against more variants, and more long-lived than injection-induced immunity. However, this is at the condition that injections do not cause longterm immunodeficiency. The linear pattern in the above figure is not encouraging, because the effect of the different injections on being infected by a new variant, omicron, is independent of the time since that injection occurred. The time since the 3d injection is on average much shorter than the time since the 2nd injection, however effects on omicron infection rates increase linearly with injection number. In that sense, an exponential increase of percentages of omicron infections would be better news, as it would indicate waning effects of injections on the versatility of the immune system. Longterm effects of injections seem cumulative. These include the decrease in versatility of the immune system as shown by omicron statistics in the above figure, and likely associated autoimmune effects, and other effects on fertility, and oncogenicity.
