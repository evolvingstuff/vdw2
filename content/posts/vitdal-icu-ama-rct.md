Helps those who were very low on vitamin D

Would have helped even more patients if 

limit Calcium

Provide other forms of vitamin D

Provide co-factors to increase usage – such as Magnesium

Spread the loading dose over a week

Take with largest meal of the day

No

It would not be expected to decrease HOSPITAL mortality (before the vitamin D was given), only ICU mortality

Speculate – why they changed the focus so much since the June conference/presentation

But even those who were not very deficient improved in physical strength by getting the vitamin D

“However, only half of patients treated with vitamin D3 achieved serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels higher than 30ng/mL.”

Total length of stay. 

ICU survive if 12 -20 ng initially 

ICU survive if less than 12ng initially
