#### University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health

. . over 22 years, found that severe breathing problems at night increase the likelihood of dying from cancer by  **4.8 times,**  compared to people who had no such breathing issues. 

People with moderate apnea were found to have  **double the risk of dying** .

#### Spanish Sleep Network,

Following 5,200 people over seven years, the study tracked oxygen depletion and found, for example, that people whose oxygen levels dipped below 90 percent, for up to 12 percent of the total time asleep, had a  **68 percent greater likelihood of developing cancer** , than people who did not have breathing difficulties at night.
