 **Comparison of FDA-Authorized Vaccines** ::

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  **Pfizer / BioNTech**  <br> (mRNA) |  **Moderna**  <br> (mRNA) |  **J&J (Janssen)**  <br> (adenovirus) |
|  **Efficacy**  |
| After 1<sup>st</sup> dose: 52% <br>  <br> After 2<sup>nd</sup> dose: 95% | After 1<sup>st</sup> dose: Not known <br>  <br> After 2<sup>nd</sup> dose: 94% <br>  <br> Efficacy in those 65 and older is a little lower, about 86%; however, overall, some evidence of greater protection against severe disease. | After 1<sup>st</sup> dose: 72% (moderate and severe COVID-19) <br>  <br> Similar in people 65 and older vs. younger people |
|  **Most Common Side Effects**  |
| Injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever; more common after 2<sup>nd</sup> dose. Side effects noted to be lower in people 56 and older. | Injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea / vomiting, fever; more common after 2<sup>nd</sup> dose. <br>  <br> {ANAME()}more-side-effects{ANAME}Side effects after 2<sup>nd</sup> dose more common with Moderna than Pfizer. | Injection site pain, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, fever <br>  <br> Side effects similar in people 65 and older vs. younger people |
|  **Duration of Side Effects**  |
| Can last several days | Typically one day, but can last up to one week | One or two days |
|  **Serious Allergic Reaction**  |
| {ANAME()}sar-pfizer{ANAME}Low rate of rate of severe allergic reactions (4.7 cases per million doses) but nearly double the rate for Moderna. <br>  <br> Treatable with epinephrine. Affected people should not receive 2<sup>nd</sup> dose. | {ANAME()}sar-moderna{ANAME}Low rate of rate of severe allergic reactions (2.5 cases per million doses). <br>  <br> Treatable with epinephrine. Affected people should not receive 2<sup>nd</sup> dose. | Low rate of severe allergic reactions (only 1 case of anaphylaxis in an ongoing trial in South Africa). <br>  <br> Treatable with epinephrine. <br>  <br> One case of severe hyper­sensitivity (not anaphylaxis) per 21,895 doses in pre-authorization trial. |
|  **Age Requirements**  |
| 16 years and older | 18 years and older | 18 years and older |
|  **Where to Get**  |
| {ANAME()}alternative-storage-for-pfizer-vaccine{ANAME}Ultra-low temperature freezer storage is preferred. As an alternative, undiluted, frozen vials can be transported and stored at freezer temperatures for up to 2 weeks, which may make it available to more vaccine sites. | Requires only regular freezer storage, so may be more broadly available, such as in doctor's offices, clinics, rural locations. | Requires only regular refrigeration (DNA is more stable than mRNA) and single dose, so may be available in widest variety of settings |
