Small clinical trial starting Dec 2016  to confirm it.

Total of 20 people

Take 75 g, 150 g, 225 g of Mussels daily for 12 weeks

Monitor the Vitamin D in the blood (also Omega-3)

#### [Mussel Intake and Vitamin D Status in Humans (Mussel)](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02982525?rcv_d=14&amp;show_rss=Y)

* “Recently, we have found that certain shellfish, especially mussels, contain significant amounts of 25(OH)D3, ranging from 0.7 to 9.9 µg/100 g wet weight

* . . .” this metabolite is considered 5 times more effective in raising serum 25(OH)D3 levels in humans”

* “Taking account of this potency factor, mussels could provide up to 50u of vitamin D per 100g”

 **Wonder if Clams and Oysters also have the Calcidiol form of Vitamin D**
