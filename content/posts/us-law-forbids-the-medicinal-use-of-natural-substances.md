#### [Why the Law Forbids the Medicinal Use of Natural Substances](https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/why-law-forbids-medicinal-use-natural-substances%20) Green Med Info

* According to the FDA's legal definition, a drug is anything that "diagnoses, cures, mitigates, treats, or prevents a disease”

* “Historically the FDA has required new drugs undergo expensive and elaborate multi-phased clinical trials, which are out of the grasp of any ordinary interest who might want to demonstrate the efficacy of a non-patentable (and therefore unprofitable) herb, food or spice.”

 **Note: FDA does not even permit a claim that Vitamin D can treat rickets, much less scores of other health problems.  
Note: Low-cost vitamin D testers are being sold in many countries in 2018, but no FDA approval for the US in 2019**
