#### Summary of an e-mail discussion with the author of this paper

* Most people in the US now have a low level of DDT in their blood - generally less to 20nanograms/gram

* He believes that 20ng/g level of DDT  **decreases the vitamin D level by 3 - 4 ng/ml** 

> This paper examines the slight non-linearity of that relationship

It appears that all organochlorine pesticides decrease the vitamin D blood levels.

It appears that DDT decreases vitamin D levels has been known since the 1970's

### DDT timeline subset from  [Science Heroes](http://scienceheroes.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=309&Itemid=263%20)

1947 - In 13 southern states, over 4,650,000 houses were sprayed with DDT.

1959 - More than 80 million lbs of DDT was sprayed over the US (half a pound per person).

 **1961 - DDT use reaches its peak.**  It is registered for use on 334 agricultural products.

1962 - Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring blamed environmental destruction on DDT.

1969 - Residues of DDT and its metabolites (such as DDE) found worldwide.

1970 - WHO announces that malaria has been eradicated in 37 countries, EPA established

1972 - EPA bans DDT in the U.S.

1976 - WHO gives up on eradicating malaria.

1998 - POPS Treaty proposes banning DDT.

### Interesting: DDT peak use is when the vitamin D deficiency epidemic started

### Comment by Thomas O. Feb 1, 2012

A foreign “unnatural” (manmade) chemical should be a cellular stress stimuli which demands access to the DNA library for a cell which chews up vitamin D, and since there would be no proper stimuli response to a manmade chemical the stimuli would not go away and chew up vitamin D reserves.

Evolution has only provided DNA stimuli responses to things found in nature, not manmade chemicals, which would be totally foreign to the cell and offer a stress there was no response for.

This explains poor calcium transport in birds and the weak calcium formation of their eggs, and why DDT laden birds laid eggs that broke and crushed under the bird’s own weight.

### Associations between Organochlorine Pesticides and Vitamin D Deficiency in the U.S. Population - 2012

Background: Recently low dose organochlorine (OC) pesticides have been strongly linked to various chronic diseases including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Both field and animal studies have suggested a possibility that persistent lipophilic chemicals like OC pesticides can cause vitamin D deficiency, but there have been no human studies of exposure to any chemical as a possible cause of vitamin D deficiency. This study was performed to examine if serum concentrations of OC pesticides were associated with serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in the U.S. general population.

Methodology/Principal Findings Cross-sectional associations of serum OC pesticides with serum 25(OH)D were investigated in 1,275 subjects aged ?20 in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey(NHANES), 2003–2004. We selected 7 OC pesticides detectable in ?80% of participants. Among the 7 OC pesticides, p,p?-DDT (? = ?0.022, P<0.01), p,p?-DDE (? = ?0.018, P = 0.04), and ?-hexachlorocyclohexane (? = ?0.022, P = 0.02) showed significant inverse associations with serum 25(OH)D levels. When study subjects were stratified by age, race, and the presence of various chronic diseases, p,p?-DDT showed consistent inverse associations in all subgroups, although stronger associations tended to be observed among subjects with old age, white race, or chronic diseases.

Conclusion/Significance The current study suggests that the background exposure to some OC pesticides leads to vitamin D deficiency in human. Considering the importance of vitamin D deficiency in the development of chronic diseases, chemical exposure as a possible cause of vitamin D deficiency should be evaluated in prospective and experimental studies.
