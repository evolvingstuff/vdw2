#### Payments by Drug and Medical Device Manufacturers to US Peer Reviewers of Major Medical Journals

Although conflicts of interest of journal editors and authors have been investigated,1,2 the traditionally opaque nature of peer review has hindered their evaluation among peer review­ers, despite their crucial role in academic publishing. While most journals have estab­lished conflict of interest policies for authors, fewer ex­tend these policies to peer reviewers.3 In many cases, jour­nals or editors may inquire about reviewer conflicts of inter­est and consider these while managing the peer review process, although publicly available reviewer conflict of interest dis­closures are rare. Reviewers of leading medical journals may have industry ties due to their academic expertise.

We sought to characterize payments by drug and medical device manufacturers to US peer reviewers of major medi­cal journals.

Methods | We identified peer reviewers for The BMJ, JAMA, The Lancet, and The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) using each journal’s 2022 reviewer list. These journals were se­lected for their high impact factor and reputation as leading publications of original general medical research. Because re­viewer lists did not include affiliations, identification was con­ducted using Scopus and the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System, which also provided sex and specialty information. We limited our cohort to US-based physicians due to use of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Open Payments database. Two independent abstractors (A.-L.N., L.M.) performed the search strategy for each reviewer, with dis­crepancies resolved by a third author (D.-D.N.).

We extracted general and research payments to the iden­tified peer reviewers between 2020 and 2022 from the Open Payments database, capturing payments from drug and medi­cal device manufacturers to US-licensed physicians.4 We ex­cluded ownership and investment interests because they are not equivalent to financial transfers and are less reliable than other general payments. Research payments included pay­ments to individual physicians and institutional payments for research where they served as principal investigators. Insti­tutional payments were dividedby the number of principal in­vestigators. Inflation-adjusted payment amounts in 2022 US dollars were calculated among those receiving payments.

We compared industry payments by sex and specialty using the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test with subse­quent Dunn pairwise testing accounting for multiple testing, respectively. Analyses were performed using Stata MP ver­sion 17.0 (StataCorp). Statistical significance was defined as a 2-sided P < .05.

Ethics review was not required based on University of Toronto policy. Additional methods are available in the eAp- pendix in Supplement 1.

Results | Among 7021 reviewer names, including duplicates, we excluded 332 reviewers who were not searchable in Scopus, 3257 non-US reviewers, and 1325 nonphysicians. This left 1962 unique reviewers, of whom 145 (7.4%) had performed peer re­views for more than 1 journal.

Between 2020 and 2022,1155 peer reviewers (58.9%) re­ceived at least 1 industry payment (Table 1). More than half (54.0%) of reviewers accepted general payments, while 31.8% received research payments.

Reviewers received $1.06 billion in industry payments be­tween 2020 and 2022, including $1.00 billion (94.0%) to indi­viduals or their institutions and $64.18 million (6.0%) in gen­eral payments. Consulting fees and speaking compensation unrelated to continuing medical education programs ac­counted for $34.31 million and $11.80 million, respectively. Over the 3 years, the median general payment was $7614 (IQR, $495- $43 069) and the median research payment was $153173 (IQR, $29 307-$835 637) among reviewers receiving such payments.

Male reviewers had significantly higher median total pay­ments ($38 959 vs $19 586) and general payments ($8663 vs $4183) than female reviewers. Statistically significant differ­ences in payments existed between specialties (Table 2).

Discussion | More than half of the 1962 US physicians included in this study who peer reviewed for the most influential medi­cal journals received industry payments in 2020-2022, with most payments for research. Research payments, especially those provided to an institution, may have different implica­tions than general payments for conflicts of interest. Peer re­viewers in this study received $64.18 million in general pay­ments between 2020 and 2022, representing a median general payment of $7614, larger than the median general payment to all physicians in 2018 of $216.5 Additional research and trans­parency regarding industry payments in the peer review pro­cess are needed. Limitations include that it was not known if existing relationships were relevant to the reviewed articles; that reviewers who were not US-based physicians and pay­ments from other entities such as insurance and technology companies were not captured, underestimating industry pay­ments to reviewers of these major journals; and that the find­ings may not be generalizable to other journals.

!!!!Payments by Drug and Medical Device Manufacturers to US Peer Reviewers of Major Medical Journals

Although conflicts of interest of journal editors and authors have been investigated,1,2 the traditionally opaque nature of peer review has hindered their evaluation among peer review­ers, despite their crucial role in academic publishing. While most journals have estab­lished conflict of interest policies for authors, fewer ex­tend these policies to peer reviewers.3 In many cases, jour­nals or editors may inquire about reviewer conflicts of inter­est and consider these while managing the peer review process, although publicly available reviewer conflict of interest dis­closures are rare. Reviewers of leading medical journals may have industry ties due to their academic expertise.

We sought to characterize payments by drug and medical device manufacturers to US peer reviewers of major medi­cal journals.
Methods | We identified peer reviewers for The BMJ, JAMA, The Lancet, and The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) using each journal’s 2022 reviewer list. These journals were se­lected for their high impact factor and reputation as leading publications of original general medical research. Because re­viewer lists did not include affiliations, identification was con­ducted using Scopus and the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System, which also provided sex and specialty information. We limited our cohort to US-based physicians due to use of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Open Payments database. Two independent abstractors (A.-L.N., L.M.) performed the search strategy for each reviewer, with dis­crepancies resolved by a third author (D.-D.N.).

We extracted general and research payments to the iden­tified peer reviewers between 2020 and 2022 from the Open Payments database, capturing payments from drug and medi­cal device manufacturers to US-licensed physicians.4 We ex­cluded ownership and investment interests because they are not equivalent to financial transfers and are less reliable than other general payments. Research payments included pay­ments to individual physicians and institutional payments for research where they served as principal investigators. Insti­tutional payments were dividedby the number of principal in­vestigators. Inflation-adjusted payment amounts in 2022 US dollars were calculated among those receiving payments.

We compared industry payments by sex and specialty using the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test with subse­quent Dunn pairwise testing accounting for multiple testing, respectively. Analyses were performed using Stata MP ver­sion 17.0 (StataCorp). Statistical significance was defined as a 2-sided P &lt; .05.

Ethics review was not required based on University of Toronto policy. Additional methods are available in the eAp- pendix in Supplement 1.
Results | Among 7021 reviewer names, including duplicates, we excluded 332 reviewers who were not searchable in Scopus, 3257 non-US reviewers, and 1325 nonphysicians. This left 1962 unique reviewers, of whom 145 (7.4%) had performed peer re­views for more than 1 journal.
Between 2020 and 2022,1155 peer reviewers (58.9%) re­ceived at least 1 industry payment (Table 1). More than half (54.0%) of reviewers accepted general payments, while 31.8% received research payments.

Reviewers received $1.06 billion in industry payments be­tween 2020 and 2022, including $1.00 billion (94.0%) to indi­viduals or their institutions and $64.18 million (6.0%) in gen­eral payments. Consulting fees and speaking compensation unrelated to continuing medical education programs ac­counted for $34.31 million and $11.80 million, respectively. Over the 3 years, the median general payment was $7614 (IQR, $495- $43 069) and the median research payment was $153173 (IQR, $29 307-$835 637) among reviewers receiving such payments.
Male reviewers had significantly higher median total pay­ments ($38 959 vs $19 586) and general payments ($8663 vs $4183) than female reviewers. Statistically significant differ­ences in payments existed between specialties (Table 2).

Discussion | More than half of the 1962 US physicians included in this study who peer reviewed for the most influential medi­cal journals received industry payments in 2020-2022, with most payments for research. Research payments, especially those provided to an institution, may have different implica­tions than general payments for conflicts of interest. Peer re­viewers in this study received $64.18 million in general pay­ments between 2020 and 2022, representing a median general payment of $7614, larger than the median general payment to all physicians in 2018 of $216.5 Additional research and trans­parency regarding industry payments in the peer review pro­cess are needed. Limitations include that it was not known if existing relationships were relevant to the reviewed articles; that reviewers who were not US-based physicians and pay­ments from other entities such as insurance and technology companies were not captured, underestimating industry pay­ments to reviewers of these major journals; and that the find­ings may not be generalizable to other journals.
