1.  **Myth: Excess vitamin D will turn the human body into marble** 

> Until recently medical students were told that > 2,000 IU of vitamin D could cause toxicity and Calcifications

> It is difficult to unlearn something.

> See [Myth for 50 years: 2000 IU of vitamin D is toxic - still taught as fact in 2010](/posts/myth-for-50-years-2000-iu-of-vitamin-d-is-toxic-still-taught-as-fact-in-2010)

   * Williams Syndrome mistaken diagnosis

   * Or. perhaps due to an ancient translation error [1000 IU of vitamin D (per kg) can indeed be toxic – 1947](/posts/1000-iu-of-vitamin-d-per-kg-can-indeed-be-toxic-1947)

1.  **Would require ignoring the position of the medical profession on supplements.** 

> Medical societies first supported then reversed themselves on the need for supplements

> Doctors got burned by first telling patients to take supplement X and then later having the patients stop taking supplement X

> Doctors are reluctant to endure yet another supplement reversal

> &nbsp;

1.  **Risk being sued if exceed guidelines** 

> Increase risk of being sued for <a href="/posts/malpractice" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2620">Malpractice</a> if exceeds current medical guidelines

> Example: prescribe <a href="/posts/6000-iu-of-vitamin-d-during-pregnancy" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 816">6,000 IU of vitamin D during pregnancy</a> instead of the 400 IU in most guidelines

> &nbsp;

1.  **Experts do not agree on how much is needed** 

> There is a worldwide agreement that 400 IU of vitamin D is needed to prevent Rickets, but <a href="/posts/little-else-is-agreed-upon" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1293">little else is agreed upon</a>

> (Raised to 600 IU in the US in 2010, most countries are still at 400 IU, and some are still at 200 IU)

1.  **Doctors are rarely been trained in nutrition** 

> [When I went to medical school, nutrition was not really on the radar](http://www.inforum.com/event/article/id/358757/group/Life/), 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and taking vitamins was even trivialized by some as a great way to “make expensive urine.”

> Vitamin D is arguably the most complex supplement - the amount needed varies with: 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Weight, Skin color, Latitude, Season, Co-factors, Current meal, Recent surgery/trauma, Neighborhood, etc.

1.  **Medical training has an emphasis on treatment, not prevention** 

> Medical training and practice emphasizes treatment, not prevention. 

> The primary benefit of vitamin D is prevention. (but Vitamin D does <a href="/posts/treat-70-diseases" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1886">treat 70+ diseases</a>) but typically need >5,000 IU

> They have learned that most patients are either reluctant to change so as to prevent a future problem (lose weight, stop smoking, . . ) 

> or will often not continue with the change.  So why should the doctor try?

1.  **Doctors have tried prescribing small vitamin D doses recommended by govts., but with minimal success** 

> A frequent sequence of events:

> 1) A doctor hears that people might have low Vitamin D

> 2) The doctor recommends a vitamin D test for some of his patients

> 3) The test result often shows low

> 4) The doctor prescribes the RDA (far too little)

> 5) Retesting finds that the levels did not rise and patient-reported no health improvement (too little dose or test too soon)

> 6) The country/health profession decides that tests are costly and do not improve health

1.  **Doctors often can only prescribe D2 anyway (true in US [before March, 2012](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-view_blog_post.php?postId=72))** 

> Kaiser Health research continues to only use Vitamin D2 (2019)

> Some doctors are aware that <a href="/posts/d2-does-not-help-nearly-as-much-as-d3" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2138">D2 does not help nearly as much as D3</a>

> And, in some cases, Vitamin D2 actually lowers levels of D3

1.  **Doctors have too little time to read outside of their specialty**

1.  **Seems like too much of a “wonder drug”** 

> ‘Nothing can be that great’

> &nbsp; 

1.  **Fear possible loss of income**  

> If Vitamin D is truly a ‘wonder drug’, it would reduce the number of patient visits, and therefore reduce income.

> Note: in 2012 [one doctor reduced patient visits from 4 per year to 1 per year](/posts/dr-who-got-patients-to-vitamin-d-level-of-80-ng) by getting all 2,000+ patients to have  >80 ng &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Net result of vitamin D: Lost too much business and retired early.

1.  **Might fear the loss of control and respect if people can deal with some of their own health problems**

1.  **No profit for Big Pharma, so doctors not rewarded** 

> &nbsp;

1.  **The Vitamin D dose needed often varies by 4X between individuals for many health problems** 

> Doctors prefer using a single dose of a drug for all patients

> &nbsp;

1.  **Doctors are uncomfortable prescribing 4,000+ IU of vitamin D** 

> &nbsp;

1.  **in many countries doctors can only prescribe D2 (which does not work as well), not D3** 

> &nbsp;

1.  **Doctors often just want to use a monotherapy** 

> Reluctant to also prescribe Zinc or Resveratrol or Magnesium or Omega-3. etc. when needed
