INTRODUCTION:

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a prevalent syndrome that is associated with multiple urinary tract symptoms and could affect the patient's quality of life and well-being. Vitamin D is shown to be linked to OAB syndrome, which exacerbated by stress conditions. This study evaluated the relationship between vitamin D status, daily calcium intake and OAB, and the associated psychological symptoms.

METHODS:

The study included 55 patients with OAB and 129 healthy controls. Psychological symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Serum vitamin D was measured. Patients with OAB with low vitamin D level received orally vitamin D supplementation. Urinary symptoms, psychological symptoms, and quality of life were evaluated before and after vitamin D supplementation plus dairy products.

RESULTS:

Vitamin D deficiency was more prevalent in 

* cases (80%) vs controls (34.9%). 

* Depression (43.7% vs 20.2%) and 

* anxiety (52.8% vs 10.9%) scores (HADS, ≥8) were also more frequent in cases vs controls, respectively. 

* Some 85.5% of the patients' group had musculoskeletal pain vs 0.0% for the control. 

Depression was negatively correlated with daily calcium intake and positively with anxiety. Logistic regression analysis revealed that age, vitamin D, and anxiety scores were significant predictors of OAB. Vitamin D supplements with increased calcium intake had significant improvement in urinary symptoms, psychological distress, and quality of life.

CONCLUSIONS:

Vitamin D supplements and improved calcium intake may improve urinary and psychological symptoms and quality of life among patients with OAB syndrome. Assessment for vitamin D status in patients with OAB may be warranted.

Objectives: To evaluate the impact of serum vitamin D level on male **lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).** 

Patients and methods: Men with LUTS who visited the outpatient clinic of the urology department at one of two hospitals between March 2014 and April 2017 were eligible for inclusion in the study. The impact of vitamin D on LUTS was evaluated using multivariate analysis to adjust for age, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen, testosterone, glycated haemoglobin, physical activity and prostate volume. To exclude the effect of seasons, we also analysed the impact during each season.

Results: Vitamin D level was lowest in winter. According to the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS), the severity of LUTS peaked in winter. There were no seasonal differences between prostate volume, maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax ) and post-void residual urine volume (PVR). For all patients, multivariate analysis showed that lower vitamin D level was significantly associated with higher total OABSS, whereas it was not associated with prostate volume, Qmax , PVR or total IPSS. In winter, lower vitamin D level was significantly associated with higher total OABSS based on multivariate analysis, whereas it was not during other seasons. In patients with vitamin D deficiency, the total OABSS significantly decreased after vitamin D replacement. The greatest improvement in total OABSS was associated with lower pre-treatment total OABSS and higher post-treatment vitamin D level.

Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency in men with LUTS may play a role in aggravated overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms, especially in winter. Increasing vitamin D level in patients with vitamin D deficiency appears to alleviate OAB symptoms.
