 **Have you ever wondered why we are seeing dramatic increases in health problems since our great-grandparents' time?** 

A hundred years ago, people mainly lived and worked outdoors.

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/agricultureemployment.png" alt="image" width="400">

Clothes were hung outside to dry.

Children played outdoors.

Almost everyone spent most of their day outdoors.

They rode horses.

But now things have changed.

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/ac-projection.png" alt="image" width="400">

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/holick-navy-indoors-8x-more-death-than-outdoors---1915.jpg" alt="image" width="400">

We wash and dry our clothes indoors.

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="300">
<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="300">

We ride in air-conditioned autos and airplanes and trucks.

We even swim indoors.

So, what does all this indoor activity mean?

Less sun!

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="300">

Let's find out.

From sunlight, our skin makes a vital substance, Vitamin D.

Vitamin D, which is actually a hormone rather than a vitamin, has a major impact on our bodies.

It increases activation in more than <a href="/posts/2000-genes" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 4265">2000 genes</a>

This increased gene activation allows the body to combat disease.

It is these changes that help us to combat disease.

In fact, over 5000 scientific studies have shown the <a href="/posts/clear-association-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-with-more-than-100-diseases-and-health-problems" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 63">clear association of Vitamin D deficiency with more than 100 diseases and health problems,</a> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; most of which have seen <a href="/posts/dramatic-increases-over-the-past-50-years" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 4503">dramatic increases over the past 50 years.</a>

These include some of the big ones: [cancer](/categories/cancer), [diabetes](/categories/diabetes), [osteoporosis](/categories/osteoporosis),  <a href="/posts/alzheimers" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 584">Alzheimer’s</a>, [multiple sclerosis](/categories/multiple-sclerosis),[obesity](/categories/obesity) and <a href="/posts/heart-disease" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1422">heart disease</a>

Even [rickets](/categories/rickets), which supposedly had gone away 80 years ago, has reappeared.

Are YOU at risk for these diseases?

Do YOU get enough Vitamin D?

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="300">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="/posts/many-reasons-why-vitamin-d-deficiency-has-become-epidemic" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Many reasons why vitamin D deficiency has become epidemic">CLICK HERE FOR DETAILS</a>

More than 9 out of 10 people worldwide don't get enough Vitamin D.

<!-- ~tc~__Describe 40 ng optimal,and reasoning__~/tc~ -->

Ask yourself: Do you spend a lot of time indoors?

Do you wear sunscreen or protective clothing when you do go outdoors?

Many people think that <a href="/posts/10-minutes-outdoors-is-enough" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1689">10 minutes outdoors is enough</a> to get all the Vitamin D they need from the sun.

But the fact is, for most people, that unless you spend a fair amount of time outdoors every day in full sun with minimal clothing and no sunscreen, 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;you aren't getting enough Vitamin D to protect against disease. 

You need to <a href="/posts/stay-in-the-sun-for-3-hours-if-you-are-standing-up-in-a-short-sleeve-shirt-20-mi--a-bathing-suit" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1689">stay in the sun for 3 hours if you are standing up in a short sleeve shirt, 20 minutes if lying down in a bathing suit.</a>

Even food no longer provides as much Vitamin D as it did 100 years ago. 

For example, in 1900, pie crust was made with lard from pigs raised outdoors.

Back then, just one piece of a <a href="/posts/double-crust-pie-provided-2000-iu-of-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 4408">double-crust pie provided 2000 IU of Vitamin D</a>

Today, pie crust is made from vegetable oil or shortening.

How much Vitamin D?

Zero.

The good news is, you don't need sunlight or lard from pigs raised in outdoors in order to get your Vitamin D.

A simple supplement can provide all you need to prevent or even treat serious disease.

But how do you find out if you have enough Vitamin D?

You can, of course, have a <a href="/posts/blood-test" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 266">blood test</a>

A reading of  at least 40 nanograms per milliliter or 100 nanomoles per liter, is optimal.

Or, you can do a <a href="/posts/quick-easy-test-on-yourself" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2095">quick, easy test on yourself.</a>

Just press hard on each of your shin bones and then on your sternum - the bone in your chest between your lowest ribs.

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/sternum.jpg" alt="image" style="max-width: 300px;"> <img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/tibia.jpg" alt="image" style="max-width: 400px;"> 

Sore bones are an indication that you are probably very deficient.

So, let's say you are deficient - this is very likely if you have a major disease, or are elderly, 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have had recent surgery or illness, or you are pregnant; a breastfed infant would also be at risk.

How much Vitamin D should you take?

This, of course, would depend on your individual situation, but many studies indicate that 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4000 IU daily is necessary to bring the average adult up to 40 nanograms and maintain this healthy level.

<!-- ~tc~__Many charts  & information of loading lose to retore quickly__~/tc~ -->

If you know you are at risk for being deficient, you might want to start with a larger dose.

You may also want to take more than 4000 IU of Vitamin D daily if you are <a href="/posts/elderly" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 28">elderly</a>, <a href="/posts/obese" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 710">obese</a>, or plan soon to get  <a href="/posts/pregnant" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 816">pregnant</a> or have <a href="/posts/surgery" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 3411">surgery</a>.

You should start feeling noticeably healthier and more energetic within a few days to weeks.

<!-- ~tc~__Chart__~/tc~ -->

Are people starting to notice the benefits of Vitamin D? 

You bet! 

When one [doctor raised all of his patients’ levels to 80 nanograms](/posts/dr-who-got-patients-to-vitamin-d-level-of-80-ng), or 200 nanomoles, he noticed that no matter their age or health condition, 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;their average of 4 office visits per year dropped down to one visit.

More and more people are getting Vitamin D tests, a <a href="/posts/10-times-increase-in-just-3-years" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 4185">10 times increase in just 3 years.</a>

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="400">

And research on Vitamin D is accelerating - more research has now been done on .

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="400">

So, if you want to feel better and get or stay healthy, taking a Vitamin D supplement is probably the single best thing you can do for your body.

And it won't cost you a trip to Hawaii.

Do yourself a favor.
