#### What is the history of "Make America Healthy Again" [Perplexity AI FebÂ 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-the-history-of-make-am-inoKNIAER_aAcQLLcMcIhw)

The "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement emerged from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s political activities and evolved into a significant health policy initiative. The movement began as a PAC founded by Kennedy's senior staffers, focusing on health freedom, environmental integrity, and addressing chronic diseases [3](https://www.maha.vote/).

 **Key Developments** 

 **Origins and Early Movement** 

* The MAHA PAC was established following the 2024 election as a political action committee to unite health-conscious voters [3](https://www.maha.vote/).

* The movement initially focused on tackling chronic diseases, advancing regenerative agriculture, and exposing corporate influence in healthcare [3](https://www.maha.vote/).

 **Political Evolution** 

* A significant shift occurred when Kennedy, traditionally associated with the Democratic party, formed an alliance with Donald Trump, creating an unusual coalition between MAGA and MAHA supporters [7](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/rfk-trump-health-influencers/index.html).

* Health influencers like Calley Means and Vani Hari played crucial roles in bridging different political constituencies within the movement [7](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/rfk-trump-health-influencers/index.html).

 **Current Status** 

* The movement culminated in formal government action when Trump signed an executive order on February 13, 2025, establishing the Make America Healthy Again Commission [1](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-establishes-the-make-america-healthy-again-commission/).

* The Commission, chaired by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was given specific mandates to address America's health crisis, particularly focusing on childhood chronic diseases [1](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-establishes-the-make-america-healthy-again-commission/) [5](https://www.porh.psu.edu/white-house-forms-make-america-healthy-again-commission/).

The concept of addressing chronic illness through government commission is not entirely new - a similar initiative called The Commission on Chronic Illness existed in the 1940s and 1950s through collaboration between major medical associations [2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2025/02/14/trumps-make-america-healthy-again-commission-old-wine-in-new-bottles/).
