#### Vitamin-D and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): prevention and treatment. , John Cannell

 **Context.**  Autism Spectrum Disorder <span>[ASD]</span>, a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired communication, and repetitive behaviours, diagnosed in 1 in every 64 eight-year-old American children, has recently shown dramatically increased incidence, possibly reflecting increased surveillance, over-diagnosis, or being a true increase in incidence.

 **Evidence acquisition** , from the relevant peer-reviewed literature <span>[1960's-2016 (PubMed)]</span>.

 **Evidence synthesis** . Data collation on hypovitaminosis-D effects on neural function, and of effects of high-dosage vitamin D, including two randomized controlled trials (RCT) in autistic children.

Mechanisms.  Possible mechanisms of action of vitamin D in preventing and treating ASD are well known, as recently <span>[and repeatedly]</span> reviewed, reducing risk or severity through anti-inflammatory effects, DNA repair mechanisms, anti-autoimmune effects, raising seizure threshold, increasing T-regulatory cells, protecting mitochondria, and up-regulating glutathione, which scavenges oxidative by-products and clears heavy metals <span>[by chelation]</span>.

 **Epidemiological data** .  Recent meta-analysis  <span>[11 cross-sectional studies]</span>  reported vitamin D deficiency was much more common in children with ASD than in controls.<span>[ Wang T, Shan L, Du L, Feng J, Xu Z, Staal WG, Jia F. Serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in autism spectrum disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2015 Oct 29
]</span>  Another study found that new-borns who later developed autism had lower vitamin D levels at birth than their healthy siblings, suggesting that the vitamin D system is involved in ASD genetics.<span>[ Fernell E, Bejerot S, Westerlund J, Miniscalco C, Simila H, Eyles D, Gillberg C, Humble MB.

Mol Autism. 2015 Jan 14;6:3.]</span>

 **Human interventional studies**   Only two RCTs [of high-dose vitamin D (300 IU/kg/day) are reported; both finding significant improvement in ~75% of supplemented ASD children.[ Feng J, Shan L, Du L, Wang B, Li H, Wang W, Wang T, Dong H, Yue X, Xu Z, Staal WG, Jia F.

Trial registration number: UMIN-CTR Study Design: trial Number: UMIN000020281.]</span>  

An open study of infants born to mothers who already had one child with ASD, found vitamin D given to pregnant women and young children reduced subsequent ASD incidence to 5% instead of the 20% consistently reported for such infants in the literature.<span>[ Stubbs G, Henley K, Green J. Autism: Will vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and early childhood reduce the recurrence rate of autism in newborn siblings? Med Hypotheses. 2016 Mar;88:74-8.]</span> 

 **Conclusions.** 

High-dose vitamin D administration appears to improve core features of ASD, through well described actions of vitamin D on the central nervous system. Future RCTs of vitamin D in ASD may fail if lower doses are used, if subjects are sufficient at baseline, if placebo controls are treated, if pre/post RCT  25(OH)D levels are not done, and if ASD rating scales are not used. 

Overall, therefore, we recommend avoidance of hypovitaminosis D in pregnancy and childhood by supplementing all pregnant women, infants and toddlers with adequate amounts of vitamin D <span>[see Section XX]</span>.
