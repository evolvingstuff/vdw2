#### Apparently big differences in Vitamin D response to the same amount of vitamin D

 **Cannot tell if the differences are bigger than normal for other cohorts**

The high prevalence of obesity is a worldwide problem associated with multiple comorbidities, including cardiovascular diseases. Vitamin D deficiency with secondary hyperparathyroidism is common in obese individuals and can be aggravated after bariatric surgery. Moreover, there is no consensus on the optimal supplementation dose of vitamin D in postbariatric surgical patients. We present new data on the variability of 25(OH)D response to supplementation in postmenopausal obese women. It is important to recognize and treat vitamin D deficiency before bariatric surgery to avoid postoperative complications, such as metabolic bone disease with associated high fracture risk. The objective of this article is to discuss the bone metabolism consequences of vitamin D deficiency after bariatric surgery.
