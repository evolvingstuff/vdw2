### [Experimental drug against hepatitis C slows down Zika virus infection in mice](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160517094212.htm)

 **Science Daily May 2016** 

* “As the Zika virus is related to the hepatitis C virus, we examined whether some inhibitors of the hepatitis C virus also prevent the multiplication of the Zika virus in human cells.”

* “We used mice with a defect in their innate immune system. When these mice are infected with the Zika virus, they develop a number of the symptoms that we also see in human patients. Treating the infected mice with the hepatitis C virus inhibitor resulted in a clear delay in virus-induced symptoms."
