**[Benefits of Brewer’s Yeast for Diabetes](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/flashback-friday-benefits-of-brewers-yeast-for-diabetes/?utm_source=NutritionFacts.org&utm_campaign=2f3c071c74-RSS_VIDEO_DAILY&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_40f9e497d1-2f3c071c74-25209481&mc_cid=2f3c071c74&mc_eid=b95641625a) Dr. Greger March 2021** 

“In 1854, a case report was published in the precursor of the British Medical Journal, suggesting two to three tablespoons of brewer’s yeast every day could cure diabetes within six weeks.  **But it took another hundred and fifty years before it was finally put to the test**  in a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial of about a half of a teaspoon of brewer’s yeast a day for three months. What happened? A significant drop in fasting blood sugars and hemoglobin A1c, as well as an improvement in insulin sensitivity “

 **It appears that the primary benefit was due to the Chromium**
