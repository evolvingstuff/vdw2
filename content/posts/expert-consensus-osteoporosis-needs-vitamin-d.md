##### Consensus summary

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Best measurement method: serum 25<span>[OH]</span>D is identified as the optimal method for assessing vitamin D status  | level 1 evidence,  **strong recommendation**  |
| • Standardization issues: in the absence of standardized 25<span>[OH]</span>D assays, serum 25<span>[OH]</span>D levels from different clinical laboratories may not be comparable  | level 2 evidence,  **strong recommendation**  |
| • At-risk patients: measurement of serum 25<span>[OH]</span>D measurement is recommended for patients at risk of vitamin D deficiency  | level 2 evidence,  **strong recommendation**  |
| • Osteoporosis and serum levels: serum 25<span>[OH]</span>D levels should be maintained at ≥75 nmol/L in patients with osteoporosis  | level 1 evidence,  **strong recommendation**  |
| • Low-risk adults: in adults under 50 with a low risk of vitamin D insufficiency, daily supplementation exceeding 400 IU of vitamin D and 1,000 mg of calcium is not recommended  | level 1 evidence, weak recommendation |
| • Supplements for older adults: for adults over 50 at high risk of vitamin D deficiency, a minimum daily supplementation of 1,200 mg of calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D is recommended  | level 1 evidence,  **strong recommendation**  |
| • Post-supplementation testing: routine measurement of serum 25<span>[OH]</span>D within 3 months of initiating supplementation is not necessary  | level 1 evidence,  **strong recommendation**  |
| • Fracture prevention: evaluating vitamin D supplementation alone or in conjunction with calcium for primary fracture prevention in community-dwelling adults should consider the balance of potential harms and benefits  | level 1 evidence, weak recommendation |
| • Calcium and vitamin D status: adequate calcium intake and vitamin D status are essential before initiating anti-resorptive therapy in patients with vitamin D deficiency  | level 2 evidence, weak recommendation |

Background: Adequate vitamin D is essential for maintaining optimal bone health, preventing and treating of osteoporosis. However, in recent years, large clinical trials and meta-analyses on the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation to prevent fractures in populations at different risks have been equivocal. The optimal level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) remains controversial. Recommendations vary between societies. The lack of standardized assays also poses a challenge in interpreting available research data.

Methods: We systematically searched for articles in MEDLINE database through PubMed, which included meta-analysis, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that assessed measurement, diagnosis and treatment about vitamin D deficiency. The experts evaluated the available literature, graded references according to the type of study and described the strength recommendations.

Results: This expert consensus is based on the review of relevant clinical evidence and provides nine key recommendations on vitamin D deficiency in populations at different risks, especially in patients with osteoporosis. Supporting information is provided in the subsequent appendix box.

Conclusions: This expert consensus is a practical tool for endocrinologists, general physicians for the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of populations at different risks of vitamin D deficiency, especially in patients with osteoporosis. Clinicians should be aware of the evidence but make individualized decisions based on specific patients or situation.
