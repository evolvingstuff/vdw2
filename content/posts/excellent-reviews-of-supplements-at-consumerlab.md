 **I have been subscribing to their reviews for over a decade ($54/year)   
Each review includes** 

* 10-100 pages of science (with about 95% correct interpretation) 

* A tabular review of about 10% of the products on the market (those that paid to be reviewed)  

* The prices per dose often range by 10 to 1 

* A small % are rejected due to incorrect dose or contamination

* They often fail to notice that one product  is 3X to 10X more bioavailable than the  others

   * Examples: Omega-3, Tumeric, Resveratrol, Quercetine

* Rarely reviews [bulk supplements](https://www.bulksupplements.com/) - that are often 3X to 10X lower cost per dose 

* Reviews are updated about once every 2 years

      * I am unaware of any competition to their service
