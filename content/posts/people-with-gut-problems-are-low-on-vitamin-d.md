#### Vitamin D status and supplementation in pediatric gastrointestinal disease.

J Spec Pediatr Nurs. 2011 Apr;16(2):140-50. [doi: 10.1111/j.1744-6155.2011.00280.x.](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-6155.2011.00280.x.)

Tarah O'Malley MS, RD, was a Student, Central Michigan University, and is currently a Pediatric Dietitian, Clinical Dietitian, The Children's Hospital Denver, Aurora, Colorado; and Roschelle Heuberger, PhD, RD, CWMS, is Associate Professor and Graduate Program Coordinator, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA.

Purpose.? To evaluate vitamin D status and supplementation in the pediatric population with common gastrointestinal diseases. The literature was searched for studies on vitamin D status in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease, and liver disease. Vitamin D supplementation in healthy children was also reviewed. 

Conclusions.? Those with gastrointestinal diseases are more likely to have vitamin D deficiency as a result of malabsorption. Current recommendations for supplementation may be too low to achieve optimal levels. 

Practice Implications.? It is important to monitor vitamin D levels in pediatric populations with gastrointestinal diseases and appropriately treat levels that are insufficient.
