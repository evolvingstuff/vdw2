### Why vitamin D in Alzheimer's disease? The hypothesis.

J Alzheimers Dis. 2014;40(2):257-69. [doi: 10.3233/JAD-131970.](https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-131970.)

Scientists have worked for over a century to uncover the basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with the ultimate goal of discovering a treatment. However, none of the approaches utilized have defined the exact cause of the disease or an ultimate treatment for AD. In this review, we aim to define the role of vitamin D in AD from a novel and fundamental perspective and attempt to answer the following question: Why should we seriously consider "simple" vitamin D as a "fundamental factor" in AD? 

To answer this question, we explain the 

* protective effects of vitamin D in the central nervous system and 

* how the action of vitamin D and AD-type pathology overlap. 

Furthermore, we suggest that the role of vitamin D in AD includes not only 

* vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D-related genes but also the 

* disruption of vitamin D metabolism and action. 

This suggestion is supported by evidence that the disruption of vitamin D pathways  **mimic amyloid pathology** . 

We define the term  **"inefficient utilization of vitamin D"**  as any alteration in vitamin D-related genes, including receptors, the enzymes related to vitamin D metabolism or the transporters of vitamin D, and we discuss the potential correlation of vitamin D status with the vulnerability of neurons to aging and neurodegeneration. 

Finally, in addition to the current knowledge that defines AD,  **we suggest that AD could be the result of a long-term hormonal imbalance**  in which the critical hormone is vitamin D, a secosteroid that has long been misnamed.
