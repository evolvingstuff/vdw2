This begs the big question: have we gone too far? 

Incredibly, in sun-drenched Australia, more than 80% of dermatologists were found to have low vitamin D levels (3). 

In fact, their vitamin D levels were even lower than elderly patients in a Melbourne hospital! 

It's a mad stat, and leads us to ask; have we simply become too 'sun smart' for our own good?
