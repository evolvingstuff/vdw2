As of the 7th of July 2024, 775,754,322 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 7,053,902 deaths worldwide, had been reported to the WHO (World Health Organization). Nevertheless, untill the 15th of July 2024, a total of 13,578,710,228 vaccine doses had been administered, with almost no country spared from COVID-19 attacks. The pathophysiology of this virus is complicated, and several symptoms require a deep understanding of the actual mechanisms. It is unclear why some patients develop severe symptoms while others do not, although literature suggests a role for vitamin D. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in the infection or in ameliorating the severity of symptoms. The mechanism of action of vitamin D and vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is well understood. VDD is associated with increased hospitalization of severely ill patients and increased levels of COVID-19-caused mortality. Recent studies suggest that vitamin D levels and genetic variations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene significantly impact the severity and outcomes of COVID-19, especially in the infections caused by Delta and Omicron variants. Furthermore, VDD causes immune system dysregulation upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that vitamin D sufficiency is crucial in fighting against COVID-19 infection. The therapeutic effect of vitamin D raises interest in its potential role as a prophylactic and treatment adjunct. We evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D and its ability to enhance the efficacy of new antiviral drugs like molnupiravir and paxlovid against SARS-CoV-2. This review discusses the role of vitamin D sufficiency and VDD in COVID-19 initiation and progression, emphasizing the molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D exerts its actions as a proactive step for the next pandemic. However, there is still no clear evidence of vitamin D’s impact on prevention and treatment, leading to contradictory findings. Therefore, large-scale randomized trials are required to reach a definitive conclusion. A bibliometric analysis of publications related to vitamin D, immunity, and COVID-19 revealed a significant increase in research activity in this area, particularly in 2020–2024, underscoring the growing recognition of vitamin D’s potential role in the context of the pandemic.

##### Clipped from PDF: VDR variants and SARS-cov-2 variants

The role of vitamin D in influencing the severity and out­comes of COVID-19 infection has been an area of active investigation. Recent studies have shed light on the poten­tial interactions between vitamin D status and the emer­gence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. A longitudinal cohort study on the Omicron BA.2 subvariant in children found that those with vitamin D insufficiency had worse clinical outcomes than those with sufficient vitamin D levels (Peng et al. 2022).  **Mamurova et al. discovered a significant link between variations in the VDR gene and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 variants**  (Mamurova et al. 2023). This connection implies that genetic differences in VDR might contribute to the varying responses seen among different SARS-CoV-2 strains.
