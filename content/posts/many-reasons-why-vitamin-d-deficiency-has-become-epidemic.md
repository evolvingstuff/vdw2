#### Lets look at vitamin D deficiency from another point of view

 **People were evolved under conditions which have since changed** 

* People were outdoors everyday (so we could slowly adjust to the annual increase of UVB without sunburn)

* The bright sun was available throughout the year (this assumes during the last 20,000 years that most people lived within 30 degrees of the equator)

* That each person would not live very long (seniors get far less vitamin D from the sun than youth)

* That people were not obese (obese people need at least 2X more vitamin D, which is secreted away in their fat)

> If there was any weight gain, it happened near harvest time when there was lots of vitamin D and that added weight/vitamin D was gone before the next harvest

* People ate animals which lived out of doors, so there was lots of vitamin D in the meat, especially the organ meats

> Also, the animals generally ate green grass, etc. had lots of <a href="/posts/vitamin-k2" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 765">vitamin K2</a>, which is a vitamin D <a href="/posts/cofactor" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1270">cofactor</a>

#### Much of the above information is in a chart, which also shows the vicious cycles

 **Low D ==> get a disease, which further reduces the vitamin D levels**
