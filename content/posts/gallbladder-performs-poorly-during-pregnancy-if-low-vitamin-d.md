Background

Pregnant women are at increased risk of gallbladder (GB) stasis, an important risk factor for gallstones (GS). In non-pregnant women, Vitamin-D deficiency (VDD) is associated with GB stasis, which improves on supplementation. Relationship of VDD with GB stasis among pregnant women is not known.

Methods

This is a prospective study in tertiary care centre. Consecutive healthy pregnant women (12–16 weeks gestation) were enrolled. Serum 25(OH) vitamin-D was estimated, and levels <20 ng ml−1 were considered as VDD. Risk factors and clinical features of VDD were assessed. Gallbladder ejection fraction (GBEF) was assessed by ultrasound after a standard fatty meal, and <40 % was defined as stasis. Statistical analysis was performed to assess relationship of GB stasis and vitamin-D levels and identify factors associated with VDD.

Key Results

Median serum vitamin-D in 304 women was 7.9 ng ml−1 (IQR 5.7, 12). VDD afflicted 92 % of them. Women with VDD more often had GB stasis (20 % vs 0 %; p = 0.015) and had lower GBEF <span>[53.7 ± 17 % vs 59 ± 10 %; p = 0.026]</span> compared to those with normal vitamin-D. GBEF showed positive correlation with vitamin-D levels (r = 0.117; p = 0.042). Risk factors for low vitamin-D levels were urban residence (p = 0.001), lower sun-exposure time (p = 0.005), limited skin exposure (p < 0.001), higher BMI (p = 0.05) and higher socioeconomic status (p = 0.02). Vitamin-D deficiency was associated with low serum calcium (ρ = 0.457; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among pregnant Indian women. It is associated with GB stasis and lower GBEF. The risk factors for VDD were reduced sun exposure, inadequate dietary intake and urban lifestyle.
