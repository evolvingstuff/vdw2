#### [2nd EuroMediterranean Vitamin D workshop held in August 2018, in Thessaloniki, Greece](/posts/vitamin-d-dosing-weekly-may-be-better-than-daily-video) 19 videos

 **Note: EuroMediterranean workshop is much better than the Workshop which alternates between the US and Europe** 

 **The EuroMediterranean one has videos on the web. The other one does not permit videos and the papers which are published a year later hide behind paywalls**
