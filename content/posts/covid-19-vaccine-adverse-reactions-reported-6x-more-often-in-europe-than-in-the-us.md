* “The EU is reporting a 0.2 percent adverse reaction rate whereas the US is claiming only 0.03 percent, almost a ten-fold difference.”

* “Various studies have estimated that only between 1 to 10 percent of vaccine injuries are reported in VAERS.”

* Europe 162,610 injurious events and 3,964 deaths

* CDC 44,606 adverse events and 2,050 deaths

* “Although anyone can report an adverse reaction to VAERS,  **very few Americans know it exists** . The CDC notes that reporting vaccine injuries and deaths in the database is completely voluntary. Consequently, there is no requirement for a vaccine administering physician or health professional to report an injury or death. In fact, many doctors and healthcare workers are largely ignorant about VAERS' existence as is the public.”
