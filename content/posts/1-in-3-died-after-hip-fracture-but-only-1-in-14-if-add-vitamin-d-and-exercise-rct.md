#### Impact of 3-Monthly Vitamin D Supplementation Plus Exercise on Survival after Surgery for Osteoporotic Hip Fracture in Adult Patients over 50 Years: A Pragmatic Randomized, Partially Blinded, Controlled Trial.

Exercise + 3 mg of calcifediol once every 90 days after elderly hip fracture

After 4 treatments (1 year) the death rates were 1 in 3 vs 1 in 14

Calcifediol = calcidiol =25-hydroxycholecalciferol =25-hydroxyvitamin D =25(OH)D

 **VitaminDWiki speculates that they used calcidiol because**  

1. Less concern about compliance - 90 days instead of every 17 days or daily

1. Eliminated concern about the elderly liver not being able to process vitamin D 

 **Note: calcifediol is considered to be 5X more potent than Vitamin D** 

So 3 mg calcifediol = 15,000 IU every 90 days = 5,000 every 30 days = not much

OBJECTIVE:

To determine whether 3-monthly supplementation of an oral vitamin D widely used in Spain (calcifediol) plus daily exercise could influence survival at one and four years after surgery for osteoporotic hip fracture.

DESIGN:

A pragmatic, randomized, partially single-blind placebo-controlled study.

SETTING:

Patients admitted to a tertiary university hospital for acute hip fracture.

PARTICIPANTS:

675 healthy adult patients undergoing surgery for osteoporotic hip fracture were recruited from January 2004 to December 2007.

INTERVENTION:

Patients were randomized to receive either 3-monthly oral doses of 3 mg calcifediol (Hidroferol Choque®) or placebo in the 12 months postsurgery. Patients who received calcifediol were also given an exercise programme. The placebo group received standard health recommendations only.

MEASUREMENTS:

The primary endpoint was survival at 1 year and at 4 year follow-up. We also recorded new fractures, medical complications and anti-osteoporotic treatment compliance.

RESULTS:

We included a total of 88 patients, aged 62 to 99 years. Mean age was 82 years and 88.6% were women. At 12 months, 10 (11.3%) patients had died, 9 of them, from the non-intervention group. At 4 years after surgery, 20 (22.7%) had died, 3 (3.4%) from the intervention group and 17 (19.3%) from the non-intervention group. At this time, survival curve analysis showed 93% survival in the intervention group and 62% in the non-intervention group (p=0.001). At 12-month follow up, there were 18 new fractures, 9 in each group. The non-intervention group had more medical complications, with significant differences at visit 2 (p = 0.04) and 3 (p = 0.02) but not at visit 4 (p = 0.18). No significant differences between groups were found regarding treatment compliance.

CONCLUSION:

3-monthly, oral supplements of 3 mg calcifediol plus daily exercise improved survival at one-year and four-year follow up after surgery for an osteoporotic hip fracture.
