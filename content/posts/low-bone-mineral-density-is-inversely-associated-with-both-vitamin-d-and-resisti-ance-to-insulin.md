Background: Resistin is a relatively novel adipokine that has a role in bone remodeling and may regulat bone minera ldensity(BMD).VitaminD and adipokines ha ea dynamic role in the body's various metabolic processes, including bone metabolism, and may alter bone metabolism in relation to each other. This study aimed to investigate the association between vitamin D and serum resistin levels in postmenopausal non-osteoporotic and osteoporotic females.

Methods: This correlational analytical study was conducted on 161 postmenopausal females, divided into two groups, non-osteoporotic and osteoporotic, between 50-70 years. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. Serum resistin and vitamin D levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Serum calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase with spectrophotometry. A correlation was checked using spearman’s rho correlation coefficient, and multivariate stepwise regression analysis was used to predict serum resistin levels.

Results: Postmenopausal females (n=161) having sufficient, insufficient and deficient levels of vitamin D were 87 (54.0%), 64 (39.8%), and 10 (6.2%), respectively. Lumbar spine BMD (p < 0.001), total hip BMD (p < 0.001), and serum resistin levels (p < 0.001) were significantly different between the two groups. There was a significant negative correlation between serum resistin and vitamin D in postmenopausal females (rho = -0.182, p = 0.021)and osteoporotic group (rho = -0.253, p = 0.019) but non-significant in non-osteoporotic group (rho = -0.077, p = 0.509). Serum vitamin D was found to be independent predictor of serum resistin levels, accounting for only 3% variance.

Conclusion: Serum vitamin D levels were low while serum resistin levels were high in postmenopausal osteoporotic females and vitamin D is a negative predictor of serum resistin levels.

#### Serum resistin levels as predictor of low bone mineral density in postmenopausal women – 2020

Resistin, a novel adipokine may play an important role in bone metabolism. The study is designed to discover the association of bone mineral density (BMD) with serum resistin levels, anthropometric measures and to elucidate serum resistin as a predictor of BMD in postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women (n = 160) were recruited and divided into two groups, non-osteoporotic (n = 70) and osteoporotic (n = 90). BMD was evaluated by DXA scan. High serum resistin levels and low weight are independent contributors to low BMD and can influence BMD at lumbar spine, right femoral neck, right hip, left femoral neck, and left hip in postmenopausal women.

Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease characterized by low bone strength. Bone strength is regarded as the integration of bone density and quality. Osteoporosis is known to be a multifactorial disorder. The adipokines, released by the adipose tissue has a dynamic role in various metabolic processes of the body including the bone metabolism. Resistin, a novel adipokine may play an important role in bone metabolism, could be a predictor and new therapeutic target for osteoporosis, and can be used to reduce the risk of highly prevalent disease osteoporosis.

Osteoporosis is becoming a major health concern in developing countries (Gheita & Hammam, 2018). Osteoporosis, a disease causing the bones to become more porous and fragile due to decrease in density and quality of bone and make them more prone to fractures (Benzinger et al., 2016; International Osteoporosis Foundation, 2018). The worldwide prevalence of osteoporosis is over 200 million, with females affected more as compared to males (International Osteoporosis Foundation, 2018).
