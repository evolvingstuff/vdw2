#### Consumption of ultra-processed products is associated with vitamin D deficiency in Brazilian adults and elderly

Br J Nutr. 2023 Dec 28;130(12):2198-2205. [https:///10.1017/S000711452300154X](https:///10.1017/S000711452300154X)

Although studies show that the intake of ultra-processed products (UPP) has a negative impact on health, diet quality and dietary vitamin D, its influence on serum concentrations of this vitamin remains unknown; therefore, it is essential to verify the association between the UPP consumption and vitamin D deficiency. This is a cross-sectional, household, population-based study, carried out with 229 individuals aged 20 years or older, residents of the city of Teresina, Piauí, Brazil. Socio-demographic, lifestyle, food consumption and anthropometric data were collected. Food consumption was obtained using a 24-h food recall, and foods were grouped according to the NOVA classification. Plasma concentrations of calcidiol-25 (OH) D3 were determined by HPLC. Crude and adjusted binary logistic regression was applied to estimate the association between UPP consumption and vitamin D deficiency. Most individuals aged 20-39 years were vitamin D deficient (52·1 %). UPP contributed 19·9 % to the energetic intake of the participant&#39;s diet.  **This contribution was higher for individuals with vitamin D deficiency**  (22·5 %, P = 0·04). In addition, a high intake of UPP was associated with twice the risk of vitamin D deficiency in comparison with low consumption of  **UPP (OR: 2·05** ; CI 1·06, 4·50; P: 0·04). Our results suggest that the consumption of UPP may have a negative impact on serum concentrations of vitamin D; more studies are needed.

#### 2X more likely to be Vitamin D deficient if eat ultra-processed foods - 6 possible reasons

1. [UPP results in inflammation](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/6/1546), which consumes vitamin D

1. UPP results in poor guts [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41575-024-00893-5) &amp;nbsp;[2](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2023.112730) &amp;nbsp; [3](https://10.3389/fnut.2022.976547) which reduces absorbing nutrients such as Vitamin D

1. UPP contains less Magnesium - which is essential for vitamin D metabolism

1. UPP contains seed-oils (Omega-6) which block Omega-3 needed by Vitamin D

1. UPP contains more &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/fructose-hfcs-and-vitamin-d-many-studies&quot; style=&quot;color: red; text-decoration: underline;&quot; title=&quot;This post/category does not exist yet: Fructose, HFCS and Vitamin D - many studies&quot;&gt;High Fructose Corn Syrup, which is known to decrease Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;

1. People getting UPP often consume a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/cola-soft-drinks-reduce-calcium-vitamin-d-and-magnesium-many-studies&quot; style=&quot;color: red; text-decoration: underline;&quot; title=&quot;This post/category does not exist yet: Cola Soft Drinks reduce Calcium Vitamin D, and Magnesium - many studies&quot;&gt;Cola Soft Drinks&lt;/a&gt; which reduce Vitamin D

!!!!Consumption of ultra-processed products is associated with vitamin D deficiency in Brazilian adults and elderly

Although studies show that the intake of ultra-processed products (UPP) has a negative impact on health, diet quality and dietary vitamin D, its influence on serum concentrations of this vitamin remains unknown; therefore, it is essential to verify the association between the UPP consumption and vitamin D deficiency. This is a cross-sectional, household, population-based study, carried out with 229 individuals aged 20 years or older, residents of the city of Teresina, Piauí, Brazil. Socio-demographic, lifestyle, food consumption and anthropometric data were collected. Food consumption was obtained using a 24-h food recall, and foods were grouped according to the NOVA classification. Plasma concentrations of calcidiol-25 (OH) D3 were determined by HPLC. Crude and adjusted binary logistic regression was applied to estimate the association between UPP consumption and vitamin D deficiency. Most individuals aged 20-39 years were vitamin D deficient (52·1 %). UPP contributed 19·9 % to the energetic intake of the participant&#39;s diet. __This contribution was higher for individuals with vitamin D deficiency__ (22·5 %, P = 0·04). In addition, a high intake of UPP was associated with twice the risk of vitamin D deficiency in comparison with low consumption of __UPP (OR: 2·05__; CI 1·06, 4·50; P: 0·04). Our results suggest that the consumption of UPP may have a negative impact on serum concentrations of vitamin D; more studies are needed.
