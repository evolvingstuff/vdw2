Background/aim: To assess the effectiveness of three UV emitting lamps on the cutaneous production of vitamin D3, a marker of DNA damage and nitric oxide production in human skin.

Materials and methods: Human skin samples (skin types II, III and IV) obtained from surgery were exposed to three different UV emitting lamps for varying times and then extracted and chromatographed to determine the vitamin D3 content. The skin samples exposed to the 3 UV emitting lamps were also evaluated for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (a marker of DNA damage) and nitric oxide production.

Results: It was observed that the spectral output of the 3 lamps had different effects on the cutaneous production of vitamin D3, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and nitric oxide production. One lamp demonstrated optimal production of vitamin D3 with the least amount of DNA damage and intermediate production of nitric oxide suggesting that it could be developed into a device for treating vitamin D deficiency.

Conclusion: The spectral output of the experimental UVB emitting lamps significantly influenced the cutaneous production of vitamin D3 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and nitric oxide.

 **Clipped from Conclusions** 

“Overall Lamp 3 seems to be the best choice for optimal production of vitamin D3 with the least amount of DNA damage and intermediate production of nitric oxide.”
