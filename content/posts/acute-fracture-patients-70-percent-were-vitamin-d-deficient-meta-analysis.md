OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analyses are: 1) to estimate the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in fracture patients and 2) to summarize the available evidence on the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in fracture patients.

DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search of the MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases was conducted. Conference abstracts from relevant meetings were also searched.

STUDY SELECTION: We included studies that investigate vitamin D insufficiency or examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on 25(OH)D serum levels in fracture patients.

DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently extracted data using a pre-designed form.

DATA SYNTHESIS: We performed a pooled analysis to determine the prevalence of post-fracture hypovitaminosis D and mean post-fracture 25(OH)D levels. We present detailed summaries of each of the studies evaluating the impact of vitamin D supplementation.

RESULTS: The weighted pooled  **prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was 70.0%**  (95% CI: 63.7-76.0%, I = 97.7).

 **The mean post-fracture serum 25(OH)D was 19.5 ng/ml.**  The studies that evaluated the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation suggest that vitamin D supplementation safely increases serum 25(OH)D levels. Only one meeting abstract showed a trend towards reduced risk of nonunion following a single large loading dose of vitamin D.

CONCLUSIONS: This review found a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in fracture patients and that vitamin D supplementation at a range of doses safely increases 25(OHD) serum levels. To date, only one pilot study published as a meeting abstract has demonstrated a trend towards improved fracture healing with vitamin D supplementation.

LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.
