Introduction: One of the functions of vitamin D is to regulate respiratory epithelium inflammatory response; therefore, deficiency of this vitamin in the context of COVID-19 could constitute a predictive biomarker of the disease outcome.

Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of vitamin D for predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19.

Methods: Observational, retrospective study in which 154 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included, out of whom 111 survived and 43 died. Vitamin D concentration was determined in all of them.

Results: A log-rank p-value < 0.032 was obtained for survival when vitamin D concentration was used as a categorical variable (≤ 20 ng/mL and > 20 ng/mL). On Cox proportional analysis, age and vitamin D concentration were shown to be risk factors associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 (age: HR = 1.036, 95% CI = 1.016-1.058, p < 0.001; vitamin D: HR (≤ 20 ng/mL and > 20 ng/mL) = 0.478, 95% CI = 0.237-0.966, p < 0.040).

Conclusion: Age and vitamin D concentration were predictive factors for mortality in COVID-19-infected patients.
