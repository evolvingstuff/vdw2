#### From http://nadir.nilu.no/~olaeng/fastrt/VitD-ez_quartMED.html  a lot more detail there

 **25 microgram = 1000 IU Assuming every other day exposure (so actually 2,000 IU every second day)** 

 **Baseline  = August, grass, pale Caucasian, cloudless, 45 degrees latitude; hands+ face + arms exposed, every other day.** 

* Time to get an average of 1000 IU, but in the sun every second day =  **4 minutes** 

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Change just one variable | Minutes |
| If Latitude 30 degrees* | 2 |
| If Latitude 60 degrees* | 7 |
| If Fall (Nov 1)  | 25 |
| If Winter (Feb 1)**  | 35 |
| If High Altitude (2.2 KM) | 3 |
| If Dark Skin  (Middle Eastern) | 11 |
| If Overcast | 19 |
| If older than 70 | 12 |
| If in bathing suit (75% of skin exposed)*** | 1.3 |

#### Skin percentages: Face 3.5%, neck 2%, trunk 26%, hands 6%, arms 14%, legs 14%, thighs 18%.

 **Concerning hands - unsure if the palms generate any vitamin D since palms generally do not tan** 

#### Latitudes

 **30 degrees** Florida, Cairo, Chongquing, Perth

 **45 degrees**   Seattle, Ottawa, Paris, Harbin, Tasmania

 **60 degrees**  Anchorage, Scotland, Oslo, Moscow

   * Ignores the possibility of 'vitamin D winter' = too low intensity to make any vitamin D
