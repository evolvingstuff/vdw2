Background and aims: In this study, the aim is to explore whether frailty status modified the associations of serum 25(OH)D levels with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the oldest old Chinese population.

Methods and results: A total of 1411 participants aged  **at least 80 years**  were enrolled in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). Information on serum 25(OH)D level, frailty status, and covariates were examined at baseline. All-cause and cause-specific mortality status were ascertained during the follow-up survey conducted in 2017-2018 by using the ICD-10 codes. Cox proportional hazard models with stratified analyses were performed to evaluate potential associations. Over a median follow-up of 3.2 years, 722 (51.2%) participants were deceased, including 202 deaths due to circulatory diseases, and 520 deaths due to noncirculatory causes. 

After multivariable adjustment, the lowest quartile of serum 25(OH)D levels (Hazard Ratios (95% Confidence Intervals), 1.85 (1.45-2.36), 1.85 (1.45-2.36), 1.73 (1.31-2.29), respectively) and frailty (Odd Ratios (95% Confidence Intervals), 1.91 (1.60-2.29), 2.67 (1.90-3.74), 1.64 (1.31-2.05)) were associated with significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality, circulatory mortality, and noncirculatory mortality, respectively. 

In addition, we observed significant interactions among 25(OH)D and frailty on the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality (all P-interaction < 0.001). Similar results were found in sensitivity analyses by excluding participants who died in the first year of follow-up and using clinical cutoffs of serum 25(OH)D levels.

Conclusion: Low serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with higher risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality among the oldest old of the Chinese population, and the associations were significantly stronger in individuals with frailty.
