#### Vitamin D is one of 10 nutritional supplements which appear to treat Fibromyalgia (combo needed?) – July 2024

 **Neuronutritional Approach to Fibromyalgia Management: A Narrative Review

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/fibromyalgia-influence-diagram.webp" alt="image" width="900">

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex and common syndrome characterized by chronic widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and various functional symptoms without clear structural or pathological causes. Affecting approximately 1–5% of the global population, with a higher prevalence in women, FM significantly impacts patients’ quality of life, often leading to considerable healthcare costs and loss of productivity. Despite its prevalence, the etiology of FM remains elusive, with genetic, environmental, and psychological factors, including nutrition, being implicated. Currently, no universally accepted treatment guidelines exist, and management strategies are often symptomatic. This narrative review explores the potential of a neuronutritional approach to FM management. It synthesizes existing research on the relationship between FM and nutrition, suggesting that dietary interventions could be a promising complementary treatment strategy. 

Various nutritional interventions, including vitamin D, magnesium, iron, and probiotics supplementation, have shown potential in reducing FM symptoms, such as chronic pain, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and gastrointestinal issues. 

Additionally, weight loss has been associated with reduced inflammation and improved quality of life in FM patients. 

The review highlights the anti-inflammatory benefits of plant-based diets and the low-FODMAPs diet, which have shown promise in managing FM symptoms and related gastrointestinal disorders. 

Supplements such as 

* vitamin D, 

* magnesium, 

* vitamin B12, 

* coenzyme Q10, 

* probiotics, 

* omega-3 fatty acids, 

* melatonin, 

* S-adenosylmethionine, and 

* acetyl-L-carnitine

are discussed for their potential benefits in FM management through various mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory effects, modulation of neurotransmitters, and improvement of mitochondrial function. In conclusion, this review underscores the importance of considering neuronutrition as a holistic approach to FM treatment, advocating for further research and clinical trials to establish comprehensive dietary guidelines and to optimize management strategies for FM patients.

#### Fibromyalgia treated with 50,000 IU Vitamin D weekly and rehab therapy for 6 months – June 2022** Can the Combination of Rehabilitation and Vitamin D Supplementation Improve Fibromyalgia Symptoms at All Ages?  **J Funct Morphol Kinesiol. 2022 Jun 20;7(2):51. [doi: 10.3390/jfmk7020051.](https://doi.org/10.3390/jfmk7020051.)

Dalila Scaturro 1, Fabio Vitagliani 2, Sofia Tomasello 3, Mirko Filippetti 4, Alessandro Picelli 4 5, Nicola Smania 4 5, Giulia Letizia Mauro 1** 6 month Results (Group A <50, Group B >50) **<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/fibro-6-months.jpg" alt="image" width="200">

* Numerical Rating Scale (NRS),

* Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ),

* Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12)

Several studies have indicated a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and widespread chronic pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia. During this study, the effect of supplementation with vitamin D in association with physical exercise in patients with fibromyalgia was evaluated, in terms of improvement of pain, functional capacity, and quality of life, also evaluating the presence of any differences in age. A single-center, observational, comparative study was conducted on 80 fibromyalgia patients.

They are randomized into 2 groups:

* Group A, consisting of patients ≤50 years; and

* Group B consists of patients &>;50 years.

Both received weekly supplementation with 50,000 IU cholecalciferol for 3 months in association with a rehabilitation protocol. Patients were assessed at enrollment (T0), 3 months (T1), and 6 months (T2) from the initial assessment with blood vitamin D dosage and administration of rating scales (NRS, FIQ, and SF-12). From the comparison between the two groups, we have seen that in young people, supplementation with high-dose vitamin D improves short-term musculoskeletal pain and long-term functional capacity. Conversely, musculoskeletal pain and long-term quality of life improve in the elderly. Supplementing with high doses of vitamin D in fibromyalgia patients improves the quality of life and pain in the elderly and also the functional capacity in the young.

Background Fibromyalgia syndrome is characterized by extensive muscular pain and chronic fatigue. Among the pharmacologic and other nutrient supplements that have been studied, Vitamin D has garnered attention owing to the critical role it plays in inflammatory and pain pathways. We conducted a systematic literature review to examine the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in improving the clinical status of the patients and alleviating the symptoms of fibromyalgia.

Methods We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and grey literature (medrXiv and biorXiv) for observational studies, randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, and case reports published in English from January 2011 to May 2021, using the terms vitamin D and fibromyalgia or FMS. References were reviewed manually, and articles were only included if they were specific in their diagnosis of fibromyalgia.

Results 2651 studies were retrieved, with 12 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria. 11 out of these 12 studies were of high quality and showed a low risk of bias.** 11 of these also demonstrated definitive improvement in clinical status and various outcome measures following supplementation with Vitamin D.  **Conclusions Our study emphasizes an association between the supplementation of vitamin D and the improvement of the clinical condition of fibromyalgia through a systematic review of high-quality studies. The study also identified areas for future scope for research that is needed for standardizing the detection and treatment of this chronic condition through cost-effective supplements such as Vitamin D.

Background: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a clinical syndrome mainly characterized by generalized chronic pain, fatigue, sleep, and cognition disorders. The role played by vitamin D in the pathophysiology of painful syndromes is poorly known. Studies assessing the association between vitamin D and FM have presented conflicting results. The aims of the current study were to assess vitamin D levels in FM patients by comparing them to healthy controls, as well as to analyze their impact on this disease.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study comprising 43 FM patients (ACR 2010 criteria) and 40 healthy individuals. All participants had their vitamin D levels measured, and FM patients also had their total calcium, albumin, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) measured. Clinical variables capable of affecting the results were evaluated, and the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ) was applied.

Results: There was no statistically significant difference in global mean values of vitamin D between groups. In the total sample, only 4.8% of the individuals had vitamin D deficiency, which corresponded to the deficiency found in the group of patients; in the control, no one had vitamin deficiency; 39.8% had insufficient levels, and 55.4% with sufficient levels. The mean serum vitamin D values were similar between the FM and control groups (34.8 ± 12 and 34.7 ± 12.3 ng/mL, respectively; P = 0.806). However, a significant negative correlation was found between vitamin D concentration and FIQ values; that is, patients with the greatest impact of the disease had lower concentrations of vitamin D (P = 0.018).

Conclusion: FM patients did not present a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency than healthy individuals, although low vitamin D concentrations could indicate more severe disease impacts.** Clipped from PDF **“…” fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ), which comprised questions organized into 10 different items focused on investigating participants’ functional capacity, professional status, psychological disorders, and physical symptoms.”
