#### [International Food Information Council](https://www.foodinsight.org/2018-food-health-press-release-diets-organic-natural-sustainable-trending) Survey

Results of 20 minute survey of 1,009 Americans on the internet in March 2018

It appears that primarily those concerned about food and their health filled out the survey

* “Among 14 sources listed, government agencies recorded the biggest increases, far and away, in both measures. 

> 19 % of consumers said they often get such information from a government agency

> “38 % said they trust government agencies as an information source

* “Friends/family members and personal healthcare professionals tied at 30 percent as the most relied-upon sources of information

> healthcare professionals are far more trusted (66%) than friends and family (26%).”

 **So, people rely and trust medical and govt sources** 

 **Those sources in 2018 recommend smaller Vitamin D doses than is needed for optimum health** 

 **The public is now aware that a small amount of Vitamin D is healthy** 

 **What will happen when the public becomes aware of the benefits of large amounts of vitamin D?**
