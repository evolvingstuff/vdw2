Objective With the introduction of MRI in diagnosis and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors for treatment, the field of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) has undergone significant changes. We carried out a population-based study of the trends in incidence and prevalence of AS over the past 15 years.

Methods This is a retrospective analysis of provincial health administrative databases. Residents of Ontario, Canada aged 15 years or older diagnosed with AS between 1995 and 2010 were included in the study. Crude as well as age-standardised and sex-standardised incidence and prevalence of AS between 1995 and 2010 were calculated. Trends in prevalence and incidence of male and female patients with AS were separately analysed.

Results We identified 24 976 Ontarians with AS. Age/sex-standardised AS prevalence increased from 79/100 000 in 1995 to 213/100 000 in 2010. Men had higher prevalence than women, but the male/female prevalence ratio decreased from 1.70 in 1995 to 1.21 by 2010. A higher proportion of male compared with female patients with AS were diagnosed in the 15–45 age group. Annual incidence rates revealed increasing diagnosis of AS among women after 2003.

Conclusions The prevalence of AS in Ontario has nearly tripled over the past two decades. The proportion of women with new diagnosis of AS is increasing, a trend that began around the year 2003. A higher proportion of male compared with female patients with AS are diagnosed at an earlier age.

#### AS Korea - 2018

 **Trends in the prevalence and incidence of ankylosing spondylitis in South Korea,   
2010–2015 and estimated differences according to income status**

The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and incidence of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in South Korea, 2010–2015. This study was conducted using the Health Insurance Review Agency (HIRA) database, which includes information on every patient diagnosed with AS. The incidence and prevalence of AS were evaluated by age, sex, and income status. The prevalence increased linearly by 7.7% annually, i.e., 31.62 in 2010 to 52.30 in 2015 (per 100,000 persons). During the study period, the incidence was 6.34 per 100,000 person-years. The prevalence peaked for both men and women in the age range 30–39 years. Incidence peaked for men in the age range 20–29 years, but peaked for women between ages 70 and 89. AS was 3.6 times more prevalent in men than in women, and the incidence in men was 2.1 times greater than in women. With respect to income status, the prevalence and incidence of AS were 3 times greater and 5 times greater, respectively, in medical aid recipients compared to individuals with other income levels. The trend of increasing AS prevalence and the observation that 14.3% of all patients newly diagnosed with AS are medical aid recipients have significant implications for healthcare planning.
