Objective: The aim of this study was to review factors that influence serum 25(OH)D when giving vitamin D3 supplements.

Research methods and procedures: From a comprehensive search of all randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) with vitamin D3 supplementation available on PubMed up to November 2011, we selected  **33 RCTs**  with 43 treatment arms that included at least 30 adult subjects. The achieved pooled mean difference (PMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random-effects models. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses was performed for pre-specified factors, including dose, duration, baseline serum 25(OH)D and age.

Results: With a mean baseline serum 25(OH)D of 50.4 nmol/L, PMD was 37.0 nmol/L (CI:33.0 to 41.0) with significant heterogeneity among studies. 

* Dose (slope: 0.006, p<0.001), 

* trial duration (slope: 0.21, p<0.001), 

* baseline serum 25(OH)D (slope:-0.19, p<0.001) and 

* age (slope: 0.42, p<0.001) 

independently influenced vitamin D response. 

Similar results were found in studies with a mean baseline serum 25(OH)D <50 nmol/L. In sub-group analyses the PMD was higher with doses of ≥800 IU/day (39.3 nmol/L) after 6-12 months (41.7 nmol/L),with baseline 25(OH)D below 50 nmol/L (39.6 nmol/L) and in elderly (40.5 nmol/L in subjects older than 80 years).

Conclusion: This meta regression indicates that a higher increase in serum levels of 25(OH)D in adults is found with a dose of ≥800 IU/day, after at least 6-12 months, and even when baseline 25(OH)D is low and in the oldest elderly.

^Comments by VitaminDWiki

16 ng increase after 6-12 months of 800 IU of vitamin D

Many people need an increase of more than 16 ng

Many RCT have been published in the 2 years since this study stopped looking at data^
