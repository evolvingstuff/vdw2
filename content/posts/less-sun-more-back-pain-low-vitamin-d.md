#### [LOW-BACK PAIN: LACK OF SUN? BY MARC SORENSON, EDD](http://sunlightinstitute.org/low-back-pain-sun-exposure/)

* “First of all, low-back pain is pandemic in much of the world. And, it is especially common in countries where most women wear clothing that prevents sun exposure to the skin.[DOI: 10.1007/s10067-007-0603-4](DOI:%2010.1007/s10067-007-0603-4) 

* “One of the first studies to show an association between LBP and reduced sun exposure was done in England: ] Northerners were 3-4 times as likely to suffer low-back pain as southerners. Of course, we know that there is less sunshine in the north.”

   * The PDF disagrees "Geographical differences in the prevalence of low back pain were remarkably small."
