&lt;p>Background: Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are a global health problem with northern countries such as Canada at particular risk. A number of sociodemographic factors have been reported to be associated with low vitamin D levels but prior studies have been limited by the ability of the researchers to gather this data directly from clinical trial participants. The purpose of this study was to use a novel methodology of inferring sociodemographic variables to evaluate the correlates of vitamin D levels in individuals dwelling in the City of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Schizophrenia high and increasing in Canada – lower vitamin D and more dark skin</title><link>/posts/schizophrenia-high-and-increasing-in-canada-lower-vitamin-d-and-more-dark-skin.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/schizophrenia-high-and-increasing-in-canada-lower-vitamin-d-and-more-dark-skin.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="are-the-rates-of-schizophrenia-unusually-high-in-canada">Are the rates of schizophrenia unusually high in Canada?&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Two major risk factors for schizophrenia are present in Canada, high latitude and a large and growing immigrant population. Consequently, one would expect unusually high rates of schizophrenia and an increase in these rates over time. This systematic review tests these two hypotheses. Searches of electronic databases were performed through 2011. Out of 45 studies 12 fulfilled all the inclusion criteria. The means of Canadian and international rates were compared by one-tailed unequal variance t-test. Trends with time in Canadian rates were tested by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D levels continue to fall: Canada 6 percent drop from 2009 to 2011</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-levels-continue-to-fall-canada-6-percent-drop-from-2009-to-2011.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-levels-continue-to-fall-canada-6-percent-drop-from-2009-to-2011.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vitamin-d-society-press-releasehttpwwwprwebcomreleases20132prweb10380382htm">&lt;a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/2/prweb10380382.htm">Vitamin D Society Press Release&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>I applaud the new vitamin D in adult health and disease guideline statement. Certainly this is a step in the right direction. Average 25(OH)D levels in all studies in Canada,2 including Health Canada’s household studies, are consistently below the recommended 75 – 80 nmol/L. Supplementation with 1000IU of vitamin D3 in the general population would result in a mean 25(OH)D level slightly above 85 nmol/L still leaving 20% – 30% of Canadians below the suggested 75 nmol/L. That’s not good enough. These studies show that children and teens have significant insufficiency. Addressing osteoporosis early will influence peak bone mass and result in stronger bones for the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dark Skinned youths and vitamin D in Southern Canada - Dissertation 2011</title><link>/posts/dark-skinned-youths-and-vitamin-d-in-southern-canada-dissertation-2011.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dark-skinned-youths-and-vitamin-d-in-southern-canada-dissertation-2011.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-metabolites-in-young-adults-of-diverse-ancestry-living-in-the-greater-toronto-area">Vitamin D Metabolites in Young Adults of Diverse Ancestry Living in the Greater Toronto Area&lt;/h4>

&lt;h4 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Vitamin D plays a critical role in bone metabolism and many cellular and immunological processes, and low vitamin D levels have been associated with several chronic and infectious diseases. Previous studies have reported that many otherwise healthy adults of European ancestry living in Canada have low vitamin D concentrations during the wintertime. However, individuals of non-European ancestry are at a higher risk of having low vitamin D levels. This thesis examined vitamin D status in a sample of young adults of diverse ancestry living in the Greater Toronto Area. In my research I found that:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Canadian Vitamin D deficiency</title><link>/posts/canadian-vitamin-d-deficiency.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/canadian-vitamin-d-deficiency.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="the-vitamin-d-status-of-canadians-relative-to-the-2011-dietary-reference-intakes-an-examination-in-children-and-adults-with-and-without-supplement-use">The vitamin D status of Canadians relative to the 2011 Dietary Reference Intakes: an examination in children and adults with and without supplement use.&lt;/h4>
