Intestine = mouse, not human, fpr Vitamin K1 not K2

Update July 2024: K2 does not block D3 in humany [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/vitamin-k1-was-found-to-block-layclkVbSjCHFGW9WhhHXw)

This study agrees with previous studies: High Vitamin A somewhat blocks Vitamin D

The interactions occurring at the intestinal level between the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K (FSVs) are poorly documented. We first determined each FSV absorption profile along the duodenal-colonic axis of mouse intestine to clarify their respective absorption sites. We then investigated the interactions between FSVs during their uptake by Caco-2 cells. Our data show that vitamin A was mostly absorbed in the mouse proximal intestine, while vitamin D was absorbed in the median intestine, and vitamin E and K in the distal intestine. Significant competitive interactions for uptake were then elucidated among vitamin D, E and K, supporting the hypothesis of common absorption pathways. Vitamin A also significantly decreased the uptake of the other FSVs but, conversely, its uptake was not impaired by vitamins D and K and even promoted by vitamin E. These results should be taken into account, especially for supplement formulation, to optimise FSV absorption.
