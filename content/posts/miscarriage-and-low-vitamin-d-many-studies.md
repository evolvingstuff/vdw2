Introduction: Early prediction and intervention are crucial for the prognosis of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (uRSA). The main purpose of this study is to establish a risk prediction model for uRSA based on routine pre-pregnancy tests, in order to provide clinical physicians with indications of whether the patients are at high risk.

Methods: This was a retrospective study conducted at the Prenatal Diagnosis Center of Henan Provincial People's Hospital between January 2019 and December 2022. Twelve routine pre-pregnancy tests and four basic personal information characteristics were collected. Pre-pregnancy tests include thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine thyroid (FT4), thyroxine (TT4), total triiodothyronine (TT3), peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab), thyroid globulin antibody (TG-Ab), 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25-(OH) D]</span>, ferritin (Ferr), Homocysteine (Hcy), vitamin B12 (VitB12), folic acid (FA). Basic personal information characteristics include age, body mass index (BMI), smoking history and drinking history. Logistic regression analysis was used to establish a risk prediction model, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) were employed to evaluate the performance of prediction model.

Results: A total of 140 patients in uRSA group and 152 women in the control group were randomly split into a training set (n = 186) and a testing set (n = 106). Chi-square test results for each single characteristic indicated that, FT3 (p = 0.018), FT4 (p = 0.048), 25-(OH) D (p = 0.013) and FA (p = 0.044) were closely related to RSA. TG-Ab and TPO-Ab were also important characteristics according to clinical experience, so we established a risk prediction model for RSA based on the above six characteristics using logistic regression analysis. The prediction accuracy of the model on the testing set was 74.53%, and the area under ROC curve was 0.710. DCA curve indicated that the model had good clinical value.

Conclusion: Pre-pregnancy tests such as FT3, FT4, TG-Ab, 25-(OH)D and FA were closely related to uRSA. This study successfully established a risk prediction model for RSA based on routine pre-pregnancy tests.

#### All 4 of the reasons for Miscarriage found to be related to vitamin D – Dec 2021

 **Vitamin D insufficiency as a risk factor for reproductive losses in miscarriage** 

Gynecol Endocrinol . 2021;37(sup1):8-12. [doi: 10.1080/09513590.2021.2006451.](https://doi.org/10.1080/09513590.2021.2006451.)

V E Radzinsky 1, F U Ramazanova 1, M B Khamoshina 1, M M Azova 1, M R Orazov 1, A A Orazmuradov 1

Objective: To study the relationship between vitamin D deficiency, VDR gene polymorphism rs10735810 (A > G), and a missed abortion in the first trimester of gestation; to determine the predictors of its risk.

Research methods: 178 women aged between 18 and 41 were surveyed. The main group consisted of patients with miscarriage (n = 101), verified at the hospital stage (O02.0; O02.1), which were stratified by I group (n = 58, patients with the first miscarriage) and II groups (n = 43, patients with repeated miscarriage). The control group (n = 77) consisted of women with a successful pregnancy (Z34.0), which subsequently ended in delivery at term with a live fetus. Patients were surveyed and data was extracted from primary medical records. The level of 25(OH)D in the blood serum was investigated by mass spectrometry (n = 99). Genotyping for the vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism rs10735810 (VDR A > G) was performed for 177 patients. Statistical data analysis was performed via Statistica 10 and SAS JMP 11 application packages, using single-factor prediction for quantitative and binary factors, ROC analysis, and CHAID decision tree construction.

Results of the study: WE found that patients with miscarriage in the first trimester of gestation (n = 60) more frequently than those in the control group (n = 39) had vitamin D insufficiency (93.3% versus 76.9%, p = .0183) including its deficiency, occurring at 25(OH)D of blood <20 ng/ml (71.7% versus 51.3%, p = .0392). This pattern was found in patients with the first miscarriage, where significant differences in the frequency of vitamin D deficiency were also detected in comparison with the control group (80.0% versus 51.3%, p = .0026). No direct correlation was found between the frequency of miscarriages in the first trimester and the variant of the polymorphism of the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR A > G <span>[rs10735810]</span>); the GG genotype in patients with repeated miscarriages was even less frequent compared to the control group (14.0% versus 23.7%, p = .3344). 

However, the decision tree has identified  **four risk classes**  and has determined that the highest risk of missed abortion in the cohort studied is formed by three predicates: smoking, serum level 25(OH)D < 6.5 ng/ml and VDR AA and GG genotypes.

Conclusion: The data obtained show that vitamin D insufficiency plays a pathogenetically significant role in early reproductive losses associated with miscarriages, both first and recurrent.

#### Risks and costs of miscarriages - April 2021

 **Miscarriage matters: the epidemiological, physical, psychological, and economic costs of early pregnancy loss** 

Published:April 26, 2021 [PDF draft is free](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00682-6)

Miscarriage is generally defined as the loss of a pregnancy before viability. An estimated 23 million miscarriages occur every year worldwide, translating to 44 pregnancy losses each minute. The pooled risk of miscarriage is 15·3% (95% CI 12·5–18·7%) of all recognised pregnancies. The population prevalence of women who have had one miscarriage is 10·8% (10·3–11·4%), two miscarriages is 1·9% (1·8–2·1%), and three or more miscarriages is 0·7% (0·5–0·8%). 

Risk factors for miscarriage include 

* very young or older female age (younger than 20 years and older than 35 years),

* older male age (older than 40 years), 

* very low or very high body-mass index,

* Black ethnicity, 

* previous miscarriages, 

* smoking, 

* alcohol, 

* stress, 

* working night shifts, 

* air pollution, and 

* exposure to pesticides. 

The consequences of miscarriage are both physical, such as bleeding or infection, and psychological. Psychological consequences include increases in the risk of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicide. Miscarriage, and especially recurrent miscarriage, is also a sentinel risk marker for obstetric complications, including preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, and stillbirth in future pregnancies, and a predictor of longer-term health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and venous thromboembolism. 

The costs of miscarriage affect individuals, health-care systems, and society. 

The short-term national economic cost of miscarriage is estimated to be £471 million per year in the UK. 

As recurrent miscarriage is a sentinel marker for various obstetric risks in future pregnancies, women should receive care in preconception and obstetric clinics specialising in patients at high risk. As psychological morbidity is common after pregnancy loss, effective screening instruments and treatment options for mental health consequences of miscarriage need to be available. We recommend that miscarriage data are gathered and reported to facilitate comparison of rates among countries, to accelerate research, and to improve patient care and policy development.
