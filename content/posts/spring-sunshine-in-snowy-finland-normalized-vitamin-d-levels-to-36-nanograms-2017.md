#### The effect of vernal solar UV radiation on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration depends on the baseline level: observations from a high latitude in Finland.

 **Summary, observations and questions by VitaminDWiki** 

* 12 hours outdoors with face and hands exposed (7% of body area)

* Baseline average Vitamin D levels = 36 ng 

   * due probably to sun, tanning bed, fatty fish, and/or supplements

* UV Index varied from 1.2 to 2.7

* Vitamin D levels were raised if < 36 ng

* Vitamin D levels were reduce if > 36 ng

1. Well known that UVB increases Vitamin D and that UVA decreases Vitamin D

1. Might UVA/UVB ratio change with amount of snow reflectivity (albedo)?

1. Might the 36 ng normalization level change at different times of the year?

   * No UVA to decrease the levels

   * Suspect: 12 cents of Vitamin D would increase more than 12 hours in snowy Finland
