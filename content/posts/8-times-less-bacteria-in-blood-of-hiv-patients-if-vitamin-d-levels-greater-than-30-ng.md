OBJECTIVE:

Vitamin D has been linked to the immune response modulation and the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Therefore, vitamin D might be involved in bacterial translocation related to HIV infection. Our major aim was to analyze the association between plasma levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA (bactDNA) in 120 HIV/hepatitis c virus (HCV) coinfected patients.

DESIGN:

Cross-sectional study.

METHODS:

Plasma 25(OH)D levels were quantified by enzyme immunoassay. The vitamin D status was defined as deficient (<25 nmol/l), insufficient (25-74 nmol/l), and optimal (=75 nmol/l) plasma levels. Plasma bactDNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. For bactDNA levels the cutoffs used were as follows: low [<p25th (46 copies/µl)](<p25th%20(46%20copies/µl)), moderate [p25th to p50th (78 copies/µl)](p25th%20to%20p50th%20(78%20copies/µl)), high [p50th to p75th (159 copies/µl)](p50th%20to%20p75th%20(159%20copies/µl)), and very high (>p75th).

RESULTS:

Eighteen (15%) patients had 25(OH)D deficiency, 93 (77.5%) had insufficiency and nine (7.5%) had 25(OH)D optimal values. 

The bactDNA levels were lower in patients with 25(OH)D at least 75 nmol/l [37 copies/µl](37%20copies/µl) than in patients with 25(OH)D insufficiency [84.2 copies/µl; P = 0.042](84.2%20copies/µl;%20P%20=%200.042). 

Conversely, low bactDNA levels (<p25th) were found in 66.7% of patients with 25(OH)D optimal levels, whereas bactDNA levels above p25th were found only in 11.1% of them (P = 0.029). 

The plasma 25(OH)D not less than 75 nmol/l was associated with low bactDNA levels (<p25th) <span>[adjusted OR = __8.13__ (95% confidence interval = 1.82; 36.67); P = 0.006)]</span>. The patients with optimal vitamin D status [25(OH)D =75 nmol/l](25(OH)D%20=75%20nmol/l) had lower plasma levels of CCL7 (P = 0.047) and basic fibroblast growth factor (P = 0.042).

CONCLUSION:

The optimal vitamin D status was associated with low bacterial translocation and inflammation in HIV/HCV coinfected patients.
