Introduction Ovarian cancer has very few known modifiable risk factors but dietary studies suggest a role for vitamin D and calcium in the prevention of ovarian cancer. Thus, we investigated the association between pre-diagnostic serum calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) on the risk of later development of ovarian cancer.

Methods We conducted a population-based nested case–control study within the Finnish Maternity Cohort (FMC). The cohort subset comprised 172 ovarian cancer cases with 172 matched controls (age ± 1 year, parity and season of blood donation ± 2 weeks).

Results We observed a significant inverse association between calcium and ovarian cancer risk. Relative risk (estimated as odds ratio, OR) comparing the highest quartile to the lowest quartile was significantly decreased; 0.41 <span>[95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19–0.85, P-trend 0.004]</span>. Even though a comparable association between 25-OHD and ovarian cancer did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.26–1.24, P-trend 0.07), having sufficient (>75 nmol/L) serum 25-OHD levels compared to insufficient serum 25-OHD was associated with a significantly decreased risk of ovarian cancer (OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.12–0.91, p-value 0.03). No synergistic protective interaction between high levels of calcium and 25-OHD against ovarian cancer was observed, the joint effect being just multiplicative.

Conclusion  **Calcium and vitamin D act independently to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer** . The decreased risk of ovarian cancer associated with pre-diagnostic serum calcium and vitamin D needs to be evaluated further for possible new insights into ovarian cancer prevention.

Objectives

Ecological studies have long described a higher incidence of ovarian cancer in more extreme latitudes, where sun exposure, and presumably vitamin D exposure, is lower. Basic science studies have also noted polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor in ovarian cancers. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship of serum vitamin D to ovarian cancer.

Methods

A case–control study of 7273 subjects from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) was performed. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels were examined in both ovarian cancer patients and a control population. Logistic regression examined the odds of ovarian cancer for those with vitamin D levels below the median of the U.S. population.

Results

Ovarian cancer cases were more than three times more likely to have low 25<span>[OH]</span>D levels (OR 3.68, 95% CI 1.03–13.21, p = 0.04). In the weighted multivariate model, the relationship persisted after adjusting for potential confounders, including age, body mass index, and diet. Adjusting for significant covariates, which included age and dietary calcium intake, ovarian cancer cases were nearly four times more likely to have low 25<span>[OH]</span>D levels (OR 3.92, 95% CI 1.11–13.85, p = 0.03).

Conclusions

Prevalent ovarian cancer cases have lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) than the general population. Deficiency in vitamin D may provide an etiologic link between the long-known ecologic findings regarding latitude and the basic science noting polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor.

---

The study included data from 7,273 participants, 28 of whom had ovarian cancer.

More ovarian cancer patients had low 25(OH)D levels:12.6 percent versus 1.6 percent

Seems like there are too few cases of ovarian cancer to be statistically significant, but p=0.03 says otherwise
