#### Relationship between Vitamin D Status and Antibody Response to COVID-19 mRNA Vaccination in Healthy Adults

Biomedicines. 2021 Nov 18;9(11):1714. [doi: 10.3390/biomedicines9111714.](https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9111714.)

The immune response to vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines varies greatly from person to person. In addition to age, there is evidence that certain micronutrients influence the immune system, particularly vitamin D. Here, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralisation potency along with 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations in a cohort of healthy German adults from the time of vaccination over 24 weeks. Contrary to our expectations, no significant differences were found in the dynamic increase or decrease of SARS-CoV-2 IgG as a function of the 25(OH)D status. Furthermore, the response to the first or second vaccination, the maximum SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations achieved, and the decline in SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations over time were not related to 25(OH)D status. We conclude that the vaccination response, measured as SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentration, does not depend on 25(OH)D status in healthy adults with moderate vitamin D status.
