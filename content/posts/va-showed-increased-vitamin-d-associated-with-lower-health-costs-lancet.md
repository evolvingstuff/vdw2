Naveed Sattar and colleagues 1 highlight increasing requests for vitamin D measurement and the associated costs. The need to contain health-care costs is universal, especially in western countries where they are increasing at an unsustainable rate. We agree that vitamin D deficiency is prolific worldwide. However, we have major areas of disagreement regarding testing and monitoring of vitamin D.

There are many correlates with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, but studies that used common laboratory tests and included latitude and seasonality were unable to predict vitamin D deficiency,  **suggesting that there is no substitute for 25-hydroxyvitamin D testing.2**  We too have noticed a marked increase in testing for vitamin D status in recent years. However, in a study of six Veterans Medical Centers in the southeastern USA, the lowest overall medical costs were in the medical centres that did follow-up vitamin D testing.3 In particular, across all sites, vitamin D deficiency combined with lack of monitoring predicted increased inpatient health-care costs.3

 **One option**  to reduce the costs of vitamin D testing would be to  **supplement the general population with 1000—2000 IU vitamin D3** , as recommended by the Endocrine Society.4 Indeed, such an approach has been postulated to result in a substantial reduction in global health-care costs.5 The greatest benefits accrue to those with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations below 50 nmol/L; optimum concentrations should be at least 75—100 nmol/L.4, 5
