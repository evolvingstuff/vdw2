#### Vitamin D metabolite profiling using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)

Pages 110-114

Glenville Jones, Martin Kaufmann

Purchase PDF - $35.95

 **Highlights** 

* The 50 year history of vitamin D assays has seen a number of different technologies used from competitive-protein binding assays to radioimmunoassays to high pressure liquid chromatography-based assays.

* Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) is emerging as the method of choice for vitamin D metabolite analysis in both research and clinical applications.

* LC–MS/MS offers improved levels of accuracy and reproducibility over traditional methods while also providing the ability to measure multiple vitamin D metabolites simultaneously.

* Evidence is presented that shows LC–MS/MS is superior for measuring 25-OH-D in testing schemes; evidence is presented that the technique can be used successfully on individual mouse samples; evidence is presented to show vitamin D metabolite profiles differ between species.

Purchase PDF - $35.95

 **Highlights** 

* 25(OH)D used to define states of vitamin D status, e.g., deficient, and sufficient.

* Unstandardized 25(OH)D data is the fundamental limitation thwarting that effort.

* Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP) was developed to correct this problem.

* In all future research, collect only 25(OH)D data standardized using VDSP methods.

* VDSP has developed methodology for standardizing stored serum samples too.

* Standardization of past research key to defining vitamin D status states is essential.

* Human reference values for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and D2 were 59–159 pmol/L and <17 pmol/L, respectively.

* Premenopausal women taking oral contraceptive pills show significantly higher 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 values compared to postmenopausal women.

#### 25-Hydroxyvitamin D assays: Potential interference from other circulating vitamin D metabolites

Pages 134-138

G.D. Carter, J.C. Jones, J. Shannon, E.L. Williams, G. Jones, M. Kaufmann, C. Sempos

Purchase PDF - $35.95

 **Highlights** 

* Both 3-epi-25-OHD3 and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (24,25(OH)2D) show a strong correlation with 25-OHD3.

* 3-epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D(3-epi-25-OHD) does not cross react in immunoassays for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD).

* Some HPLC/UV and LC–MS/MS methods may not resolve 3-epi-25-OHD3 from 25-OHD3.

* Cross reaction of 24,25(OH)2D in 25-OHD immunoassays may contribute to the positive bias of some assays, particularly at high 25-OHD concentrations.

* The use of exogenous 24,25(OH)2D gives misleading results in recovery experiments.

#### Prevention and treatment of nutritional rickets

Pages 145-147

N.J Shaw

Purchase PDF - $35.95

 **Highlights** 

* Nutritional rickets is due to a variable combination of vitamin D deficiency and dietary calcium deficiency in growing children.

* There is evidence of an increasing incidence of nutritional rickets in several developed countries.

* Prevention of nutritional rickets can be achieved by ensuring that pregnant women and infants receive regular supplements of vitamin D.

* Treatment of nutritional rickets requires a combination of oral vitamin D and adequate dietary calcium intake.

* Vitamin D supplementation of infants should be regarded as having a similar level of importance as immunisation.

#### Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy: Updated meta-analysis on maternal outcomes (free PDF)

Pages 148-155

Cristina Palacios, Luz Maria De-Regil, Lia K. Lombardo, Juan Pablo Pena-Rosas

PDF (601 K)

 **Highlights** 

* Supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D significantly increases 25(OH)D at term but results were inconsistent.

* It is unknown at this point what is the clinical significance of this finding but there is some indication that vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, may reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia.

* More studies are needed to confirm these results and to determine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of other maternal outcomes, such as gestational diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, caesarean section, gestational hypertension, other adverse conditions and maternal death.

 **Note By Henry Lahore @ VitaminDWiki** 

Study chose to ignore the trials which used more than one dose of vitamin D (so as to account for obesity, etc)

Study ignored the dose levels in the trials which it did accept - treating doses of 200 IU the same as 300,000 IU (loading)

#### Vitamin D3 and calcidiol are not equipotent

Pages 205-208

Cristina Navarro-Valverde, Manuel Sosa-Henriquez, Maria Rosa Alhambra-Exposito, Jose Manuel Quesada-Gomez

Purchase PDF - $35.95

 **Highlights** 

* It is recommended, as endorsed by international clinical guides, to use Vitamin D3 to treat vitamin D deficiency.

* In several parts of the world, the use of calcidiol at the same dose than Vitamin D3 is an extended prescription.

* Our data confirm the available evidence stating that they are not equipotent. This may lead to over-dosage.

* Calcifediol is faster and 3–6 times more powerful to obtain adequate serum levels of 25(OH)D in the medium-long term.

* This circumstance must be assessed and included in the therapeutic prescription guides of Osteoporosis.

 **Highlights** 

* We investigated ethnic differences in vitamin D production in UK postmenopausal women in response to a defined and controlled UVR exposure.

* All women significantly increased their 25(OH)D. Initial vitamin D level affects the amount of UVB needed to reach a set 25(OH)D concentration.

* The greater response to UVR exposure found amongst the South Asian women reflects their lower baseline level of 25(OH)D.

* No ethnic differences in 25(OH)D synthesis were observed; baseline differences in 25(OH)D and sample size are potential confounders.

* To confirm no effect of ethnicity or skin tone on 25(OH)D synthesis, a larger sample including other groups with highly pigmented skin is required.

#### Species-specific regulation of innate immunity by vitamin D signaling

Pages 246-253

Vassil Dimitrov, John H. White

Purchase PDF - $35.95

 **Highlights** 

* The hormonal form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, is a key regulator of innate immunity.

* In humans, the activated vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a direct regulator of transcription of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides, pattern recognition receptors, and innate immune cytokines.

* While regulation of VDR target genes implicated in innate immunity in humans appears to be widely conserved in primates, the regulation is not conserved in mice.

* Given the increasing evidence that vitamin D signaling can regulate innate immunity in mice, the combined data indicate that the mechanisms of innate immune regulation by vitamin D are species-specific.

#### Vitamin D—Cellular Ca2+ link to obesity and diabetes

Pages 326-330

Igor N. Sergeev

Purchase PDF - $35.95

 **Highlights** 

* The hormone 1,25(OH)2D3 targets Ca2+ signaling pathways in adipocytes and pancreatic β-cells.

* 1,25(OH)2D3 triggers apoptosis in mature adipocytes via induction of the apoptotic Ca2+ signal—a sustained increase in concentration of intracellular Ca2+, followed by activation of Ca2+-dependent apoptotic proteases, calpain and caspase-12.

* 1,25(OH)2D3 induces synchronous Ca2+ oscillations in pancreatic β-cells, which pattern oscillatory insulin release from these cells.

* The role of 1,25(OH)2D3 in Ca2+-mediated apoptosis in adipocytes and insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells can support the recommendation to maintain optimal vitamin D status as a plausible approach for preventing type 2 diabetes and decreasing adiposity.
