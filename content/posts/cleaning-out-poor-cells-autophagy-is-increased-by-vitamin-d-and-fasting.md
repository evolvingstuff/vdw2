Vitamin D regulates the pleiotropic effect to maintain cellular homeostasis and epidemiological evidence establishes an association between vitamin D deficiency and various human diseases. Here, the role of autophagy, the cellular self-degradation process, in vitamin D-dependent function is documented in different cellular settings and discusses the molecular aspects for treating 

* chronic inflammatory, 

* infectious diseases, and 

* cancer.

Vitamin D activates autophagy through a genomic and non-genomic signaling pathway to influence a wide variety of physiological functions of different body organs along with bone health and calcium metabolism. Moreover, it induces autophagy as a protective mechanism to inhibit oxidative stress and apoptosis to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune modulation. Furthermore, vitamin D and its receptor regulate autophagy signaling to control inflammation and host immunity by activating antimicrobial defense mechanisms. Vitamin D has been revealed as a potent anticancer agent and induces autophagy to increase the response to radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs for potential cancer therapy. Increasing vitamin D levels in the human body through timely exposure to sunlight or vitamin D supplements could activate autophagy as part of the homeostasis mechanism to prevent multiple human diseases and aging-associated dysfunctions.

#### Tried vitamin D  + water fasting - Great! - Feb 2023

By the founder of VitaminDWiki, Henry Lahore

I have tried fasting many times in my life, but previous fasts only lasted about 1 day

The fasts  were stopped because of an extreme lack of energy

In Jan 2023, our son tried water fasts, which he started with a large dose of Vitamin D

His six fasts have been  extremely successful

* felt better,

* lasted 3-4 days each

* experience no energy/brain loss during the fast

* lost about 5 lbs on each fast

* did not feel especially hungry after the fast AND he kept the weight off  (20 lbs so far)

* felt that his brain was working much better after a fast, especially ones lasting 5 days

I added nanoemulsion vitamin D and ionized Magnesium several times each day during my fasts

I successfully had many 2-3-day water fasts

 **My results were similar to that of our son** 

<a href="/posts/nanoemulsion-vitamin-d-may-be-a-substantially-better-form" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Nanoemulsion Vitamin D may be a substantially better form">Nanoemulsion Vitamin D may be a substantially better form</a>

Be sure to swish the milliliter of nanoD  in your mouth for a minute or two

This gets it directly into the bloodstream without being delayed by the stomach, intestines, lymph (?), liver and kidneys. 

&nbsp; Note: Virtually every cell in your body has the ability to fully process vitamin D

#### Vitamin D also augments weight loss without fasting

Many studies have found that people who want to lose weight by calorie restriction or exercise have much more success when they add Vitamin D ( weeks or months before starting the weight loss plan unless they start with a loading dose)

[Weight loss and Vitamin D - many studies](/posts/weight-loss-and-vitamin-d-many-studies)

 **Have been unable to find anyone on the web who has tried Vitamin D + faster fasting**

!!!!Vitamin D in autophagy signaling for health and diseases: Insights on potential mechanisms and future perspectives
Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry 99 (2022) 108841 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2021.108841

Vitamin D regulates the pleiotropic effect to maintain cellular homeostasis and epidemiological evidence establishes an association between vitamin D deficiency and various human diseases. Here, the role of autophagy, the cellular self-degradation process, in vitamin D-dependent function is documented in different cellular settings and discusses the molecular aspects for treating 
*chronic inflammatory, 
*infectious diseases, and 
*cancer.
Vitamin D activates autophagy through a genomic and non-genomic signaling pathway to influence a wide variety of physiological functions of different body organs along with bone health and calcium metabolism. Moreover, it induces autophagy as a protective mechanism to inhibit oxidative stress and apoptosis to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune modulation. Furthermore, vitamin D and its receptor regulate autophagy signaling to control inflammation and host immunity by activating antimicrobial defense mechanisms. Vitamin D has been revealed as a potent anticancer agent and induces autophagy to increase the response to radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs for potential cancer therapy. Increasing vitamin D levels in the human body through timely exposure to sunlight or vitamin D supplements could activate autophagy as part of the homeostasis mechanism to prevent multiple human diseases and aging-associated dysfunctions.

!!!!Tried vitamin D  + water fasting - Great! - Feb 2023
By the founder of VitaminDWiki, Henry Lahore
I have tried fasting many times in my life, but previous fasts only lasted about 1 day
The fasts  were stopped because of an extreme lack of energy
In Jan 2023, our son tried water fasts, which he started with a large dose of Vitamin D
His six fasts have been  extremely successful
*felt better,
*lasted 3-4 days each
*experience no energy/brain loss during the fast
*lost about 5 lbs on each fast
*did not feel especially hungry after the fast AND he kept the weight off  (20 lbs so far)
*felt that his brain was working much better after a fast, especially ones lasting 5 days
I added nanoemulsion vitamin D and ionized Magnesium several times each day during my fasts
I successfully had many 2-3-day water fasts
__My results were similar to that of our son__

((Nanoemulsion Vitamin D may be a substantially better form))
Be sure to swish the milliliter of nanoD  in your mouth for a minute or two
This gets it directly into the bloodstream without being delayed by the stomach, intestines, lymph (?), liver and kidneys. 
~hs~ Note: Virtually every cell in your body has the ability to fully process vitamin D

!!!!Vitamin D also augments weight loss without fasting
Many studies have found that people who want to lose weight by calorie restriction or exercise have much more success when they add Vitamin D ( weeks or months before starting the weight loss plan unless they start with a loading dose)
((Weight loss and Vitamin D - many studies))
__Have been unable to find anyone on the web who has tried Vitamin D + faster fasting__
