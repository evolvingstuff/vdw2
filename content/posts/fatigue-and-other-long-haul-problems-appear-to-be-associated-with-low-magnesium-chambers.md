#### Antioxidants and Long Covid

Open Access Library Journal > Vol.9 No.10, October 2022 DOI: 10.4236/oalib.1109414

Long Covid has many symptoms that overlap with 

* ME (myalgic encephalo-myelitis)/

* CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome), 

* FM (fibromyalgia), 

* EBV (Epstein-Barr virus), 

* CMV (cytomegalovirus), 

* CIRS (chronic inflammatory response syndrome),

* MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome), 

* POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), and 

* post viral fatigue syndrome.

They all portend a “long haul” with an antioxidant shortfall and elevated Ca:Mg. Oxidative stress is the root cause. 

Linkage between TGF (transforming growth factor)-β, IFN (interferon)-γ, the RAS (renin angiotensin system), and the KKS (kallikrein kinin system) is discussed. Technical explanations for the renin aldosterone paradox in POTS, the betrayal of TGF-β, and the commonality of markers for the Warburg effect are offered. 

The etiology of the common Long Covid symptoms of 

* post exertional malaise, 

* fatigue, and 

* brain fog as well as 

* anosmia, 

* hair loss, and 

* GI symptoms 

is technically discussed.  **Ca:Mg is critical to the glutamate/GABA balance** . The role of GABA and butyrates from the “good” intestinal bacteria in the gut-brain axis and its correlation with chronic fatigue diseases are explored. 

The crosstalk between the ENS (enteric nervous system) and the ANS (autonomic nervous system) and the role of the vagus in both are emphasized. HRV (heart rate variability), the fifth vital sign, points to an expanded gut-brain-heart/lung axis. A suggested approach to all of these—Long Covid, chronic fatigue diseases, post viral fatigue syndrome, and general health—is presented.
