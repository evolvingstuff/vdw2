 **~~#00F:Season of birth is a good proxy for Vitamin D (for people far from the Equator)  
Statistisically significant, but rarely greater than 20% change  
Some health problems need Vitamin D in 2 or 3 trimesters, so are not associated with season  
Perhaps some people in born in poor season will need more vitamin D all of their lives** ~~
