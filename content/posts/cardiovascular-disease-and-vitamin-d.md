# Can Vitamin D Deficiency Break Your Heart?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Mayo Clin Proc.  April 2012;87(4):412-415  © 2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research

To the Editor: 

We congratulate Hoang et al1 from the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study on their article reporting a signifi­cant association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels and depression among the largest group of in­dividuals in whom this potential link has been explored to date. The fact that this study was done as part of a medical stu­dent summer research program makes it even more impressive. In the same issue of Mayo Clinic Proceedings, Chamberlain et al 2 report that among a cohort of patients with preexisting cardiovascular (CV) dis­ease, depression independently predicted hospitalization and all-cause mortality over a 17-year follow-up period. We have recently documented strong independent associations between low vitamin D levels and adverse CV events,3-5 and some meta-analyses show that vitamin D supplemen­tation appears to significantly lower all-cause mortality,6 whereas others do not.7 Thus, it is biologically plausible that vita­min D deficiency-induced depression may, in part, be responsible for increased CV risk associated with low vitamin D levels. Additionally, the tendency for de­pressed patients to stay indoors and be physically inactive (both risk factors for vitamin D deficiency) may lead to low vitamin D levels, which, in turn, are as­sociated with increased CV risk.2 Al­though the study from Hoang et al 1 dem­onstrates that the association between low 25(OH)D levels was independent of phys­ical activity, we were surprised that these Cooper Center Longitudinal Study data were also not corrected for precisely mea­sured levels of cardiorespiratory fitness.

Vitamin D deficiency, besides being associated with depression, appears to in­crease the risk of developing inflamma­tion, insulin resistance, diabetes, and ath­erosclerosis, and also activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which predisposes to hypertension and left ven­tricular hypertrophy.3-5 All of these con­sequences of vitamin D deficiency, includ­ing depression, can adversely affect CV health and longevity (Figure).

An abnormally low vitamin D level, as defined by a serum 25(OH)D level less than or equal to 20 ng/mL, is present in 42% of the overall American adult popu­lation, 82% of black individuals, and 69% of the Hispanic population. 3 The average 25(OH)D level in adults is 20 ng/mL 8;a long-term daily intake of an additional 100 IU of vitamin D will increase this level by only about 1 ng/mL. 3-5 Thus, supple­menting the diet by the 600 to 800 IU daily as recommended by the Institute of Medicine's new guidelines 9 would be ex­pected to raise adult Americans' mean vi­tamin D levels to 26 to 28 ng/mL, which is still in the insufficient range (<30 ng/mL). Recently, the Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines10 suggested doses of 1000 to 2000 IU of vitamin D3 daily, which are much more likely to achieve a 25(OH)D level of at least 30 ng/mL.

Insufficient vitamin D causes muscu-loskeletal pain and weakness, and supple­menting low 25(OH)D levels back into the normal ranges has been shown unequivo­cally to improve integrity and strength of bones and muscles and to reduce falls.4,5 Large randomized controlled trials are un­der way, and these should help to deter­mine whether raising low vitamin D levels will also reduce risks for CV events, de­pression, and death. These results are not expected for several years (at least 3 years and possibly 5 years or more), and in the meanwhile it seems prudent to recom­mend a daily intake of 1500 to 2000 IU of vitamin D3 for most American adults. Re­cent data, including those from Mayo Clinic Proceedings,1,2 suggest that measur­ing vitamin D levels and normalizing defi­ciencies may be especially important for individuals with a history of depression and/or CV disease.
