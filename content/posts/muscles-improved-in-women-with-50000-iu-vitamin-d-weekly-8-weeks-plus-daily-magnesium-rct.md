This study aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin D and magnesium co-supplementation on muscle strength and function, body composition, and inflammation in vitamin D-deficient middle-aged women. In this study, 83 healthy middle-aged women (40–55 years) with vitamin D deficiency were randomly assigned into two groups: (1) intervention: receiving a 50,000-IU vitamin D soft gel (weekly) plus a 250-mg magnesium tablet (daily); (2) control: receiving a vitamin D placebo (weekly) plus a magnesium placebo (daily), for 8 weeks. Before and after the intervention, anthropometric indices, muscle strength, muscle function, and some inflammatory markers were measured. After 8 weeks of supplementation, significant difference was observed in handgrip strength and time for Time Get Up and Go (TGUG) test between the intervention and placebo groups (P < 0.05). Regarding percentage of fat mass (FM%) and fat free mass (FFM%), and knee extension strength, there was no significant difference between the two groups at the end of intervention (P > .05). Serum 25(OH)-D levels increased significantly (P < 0.001) and its change was significantly different between the two groups, at the end of the intervention (P < 0.001). Serum level of hs-CRP decreased significantly in the intervention group compared to baseline (P < 0.001), and the change in hs-CRP was significant between the two groups at the end of the intervention (P < 0.01). Furthermore, serum level of TNF-α declined significantly in the intervention group compared to baseline (P < 0.001) but, no significant differences were seen between the two groups in regard of serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 after the intervention (P > 0.05). 

Our findings show that vitamin D and magnesium co-supplementation, for 8 weeks, in healthy middle-aged women with vitamin D deficiency have beneficial impacts on muscle strength, muscle function, and probably inflammation.

#### Muscle improvement RCT with 50,000 IU of Vitamin D (no Magnesium) - Aug 2019

Muscle strength and quality of life improved after vitamin D supplementation among adult Saudi females

Background & aims

Physical and mental well-being following vitamin D supplementation shows contradictory data in the literature. We aimed to explore this more among young and middle-aged Saudi females suffering from vitamin D deficiency by analyzing handgrip strength and self-reported quality of life.

Methods

Fifty-eight females with bone or muscle aches attending the outpatient orthopedics clinic of an area hospital were enrolled after informed consent. Each participant filled out the SF-8™ questionnaire for quality of life (QOL) and was assessed for demographic/behavioral data, serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), and handgrip (HG) for both hands at baseline and 3 months after standard 25(OH)D oral supplementation.

Results

The mean age was 31.9 ± 7.3 years; serum 25(OH)D values increased significantly after the oral supplementation (11.28 ± 4.1, range 4.2–22 vs. 23.98 ± 6.81, range 7–41.4 μg/dl, P < 0.001) The handgrip mean for both hands after 25(OH)D supplementation also showed statistically significant higher values (13.24 ± 4.95, range 5–25.33 vs. 17.76 ± 4.39, range 9.5–27.33 kg/m2, P < 0.001). The SF-8™ QOL questionnaire results showed an overall statistically significant improvement (P < 0.001). 25(OH)D baseline values predicted muscle weakness; area-under-the-curve was 63% (95% CI: 47–79%) with the best cut-off value at 17.17 μg/dl (sensitivity 64% and specificity 62%).

Conclusion

Adult Saudi females showed improved muscle strength and quality of life following standard 25(OH)D oral supplementation.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin D and magnesium co-supplementation on muscle strength and function, body composition, and inflammation in vitamin D-deficient middle-aged women. In this study, 83 healthy middle-aged women (40–55 years) with vitamin D deficiency were randomly assigned into two groups: (1) intervention: receiving a 50,000-IU vitamin D soft gel (weekly) plus a 250-mg magnesium tablet (daily); (2) control: receiving a vitamin D placebo (weekly) plus a magnesium placebo (daily), for 8 weeks. Before and after the intervention, anthropometric indices, muscle strength, muscle function, and some inflammatory markers were measured. After 8 weeks of supplementation, significant difference was observed in handgrip strength and time for Time Get Up and Go (TGUG) test between the intervention and placebo groups (P &lt; 0.05). Regarding percentage of fat mass (FM%) and fat free mass (FFM%), and knee extension strength, there was no significant difference between the two groups at the end of intervention (P &gt; .05). Serum 25(OH)-D levels increased significantly (P &lt; 0.001) and its change was significantly different between the two groups, at the end of the intervention (P &lt; 0.001). Serum level of hs-CRP decreased significantly in the intervention group compared to baseline (P &lt; 0.001), and the change in hs-CRP was significant between the two groups at the end of the intervention (P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, serum level of TNF-α declined significantly in the intervention group compared to baseline (P &lt; 0.001) but, no significant differences were seen between the two groups in regard of serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 after the intervention (P &gt; 0.05). 

Our findings show that vitamin D and magnesium co-supplementation, for 8 weeks, in healthy middle-aged women with vitamin D deficiency have beneficial impacts on muscle strength, muscle function, and probably inflammation.

Background &amp; aims
Physical and mental well-being following vitamin D supplementation shows contradictory data in the literature. We aimed to explore this more among young and middle-aged Saudi females suffering from vitamin D deficiency by analyzing handgrip strength and self-reported quality of life.

Methods
Fifty-eight females with bone or muscle aches attending the outpatient orthopedics clinic of an area hospital were enrolled after informed consent. Each participant filled out the SF-8™ questionnaire for quality of life (QOL) and was assessed for demographic/behavioral data, serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), and handgrip (HG) for both hands at baseline and 3 months after standard 25(OH)D oral supplementation.

Results
The mean age was 31.9 ± 7.3 years; serum 25(OH)D values increased significantly after the oral supplementation (11.28 ± 4.1, range 4.2–22 vs. 23.98 ± 6.81, range 7–41.4 μg/dl, P &lt; 0.001) The handgrip mean for both hands after 25(OH)D supplementation also showed statistically significant higher values (13.24 ± 4.95, range 5–25.33 vs. 17.76 ± 4.39, range 9.5–27.33 kg/m2, P &lt; 0.001). The SF-8™ QOL questionnaire results showed an overall statistically significant improvement (P &lt; 0.001). 25(OH)D baseline values predicted muscle weakness; area-under-the-curve was 63% (95% CI: 47–79%) with the best cut-off value at 17.17 μg/dl (sensitivity 64% and specificity 62%).

Conclusion
Adult Saudi females showed improved muscle strength and quality of life following standard 25(OH)D oral supplementation.
