Legend, clockwise: 

* FDA = government agency whose purpose is largely to promote drugs over dietary supplements; 

* NIH = National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements, which is now threatening to declare all supplements are drugs; 

* Adverse Event Reporting Hotline = phone number to call if dietary supplements cause a serious side effect;  &nbsp; &nbsp; (unable to find it)

* [CODEX](http://www.codexalimentarius.org/) = comprised of representatives from different countries for the purpose of "harmonizing" the dose of dietary supplements worldwide;

* [Food & Nutrition Board](http://www.iom.edu/About-IOM/Leadership-Staff/Boards/Food-and-Nutrition-Board.aspx) = government-appointed committee that establishes daily nutrient needs for the population; 

* Big Pharma = pharmaceutical industry ($883 billion in sales) that dwarfs sales of dietary supplements ($20 billion); 

* US Dept Agriculture = plays peripheral role in making recommendations for nutrients in the population; 

* Physician Groups (AMA) = physicians receive little training about dietary supplements but somehow know all the side effects posed by vitamin pills; 

* Health & Human Services Food Stamp Program = which does not pay for dietary supplements for the group that is most needy in the population; 

* Federal Trade Commission = sanctions and fines companies who make untruthful claims about their products; 

* News Media = largely controlled by Big Pharma which sponsors most evening network TV news programs; 

* Health Freedom Organizations ([Citizens for Health](http://www.citizens.org/), [Natural Solutions Foundation](http://www.lifespirit.org/NSF-Main-Index.htm), [National Health Federation](http://www.thenhf.com/), etc) = groups that pretend to oppose restrictions on health freedoms and access to dietary supplements who tend to be alarmist and constantly seek donations; National Health Federation is only group that has standing at CODEX; 

* National Sanitation Foundation, [US Pharmacopeia](http://www.usp.org/) = independent organizations that certify the quality of dietary supplements; 

* Health insurance and Medicare = pools of insurance money that do not reimburse for dietary supplements because they are "unproven"; 

* Quackwatch = anti-dietary supplement website that somehow has high ranking on the internet, declared two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling a health quack; 

* [Council for Responsible Nutrition](http://www.crnusa.org/) = industry group that represents dietary supplement manufacturers; 

* [Natural Products Association](http://www.npainfo.org/) = industry group that represents supplement makers and retail stores; 

* Consumerlab.com = organization that is a shill for the FDA comprised of former FDA personnel who expose improperly labeled dietary supplements.
