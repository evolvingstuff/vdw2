#### Vitamin D as a Biomarker of Ill Health among the Over-50s: A Systematic Review of Cohort Studies

Nutrients 2019, 11(10), 2384; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11102384

* This study found an association of ill health with low blood levels of vitamin D.

* There is an even stronger association with low TISSUE level of Vitamin D - due to restrictions by vitamin D Receptor and other genes

   *  **The risk of <span style="color:#F00;">44 </span> diseases at least double with poor [Vitamin D Receptor](/posts/vitamin-d-receptor) as of Oct 2019**

Background: The association between circulating levels of vitamin D and the incidence of chronic diseases is known. The identification of vitamin D as a biomarker of physiological/pathological ageing could contribute to expanding current knowledge of its involvement in healthy ageing. 

Methods: According to PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was conducted on cohorts studying the role of 25OH-Vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and 1,25(OH)2-Vitamin D <span>[1,25(OH)2D]</span> concentrations as biomarkers of healthy ageing. We consulted MedLine, Scopus, and Web of Science to search for studies on the association between vitamin D status in populations of originally healthy adults, and outcomes of 

* longevity, 

* illness, and 

* physical and cognitive functionality. 

The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa scale. 

Results: Twenty cohorts from 24 articles were selected for this review. Inverse associations were found between low 25(OH)D levels and all-cause mortality, respiratory and cardiovascular events, as well as markers relating to hip and non-vertebral fractures. Associations between 1,25(OH)2D and healthy ageing outcomes gave similar results, although of lower clinical significance. 

Conclusions: This systematic review pinpoints peculiar aspects of vitamin D as a multidimensional predictor of ill health in the ageing process. Further well-designed controlled trials to investigate whether vitamin D supplement results in superior outcomes are warranted in the future.

. **Conclusions (from PDF)** 

Conclusively, 25(OH)D status acts as a worthy biomarker to predict 

* all-cause mortality, 

* pulmonary events, and 

* lung function, 

* cardiovascular/coronary events, 

* hip fractures, 

* early and/or premature death, and 

* sarcopenia incidence. 

Conversely, no association was found with the risk of falls, as well as with bone mineral density, cognitive function, cardiometabolic, and cancer events in adult populations who were apparently healthy at baseline.
