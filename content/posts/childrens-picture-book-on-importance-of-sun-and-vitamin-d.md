 **Dinosaur Douglas Has Fun in the Sun**  is the first picture book to raise the importance of  

sunshine and vitamin D for healthy growth in children, in a fun way. Featuring the cheeky but  

loveable Dinosaur Douglas, who first appeared in Dinosaur Douglas and the Beastly Bugs, it is  

written in rhyme and illustrated by street painter and artist Alex Godwin. 

“Dinosaur Douglas is having fun 

Playing with friends out in the sun 

His eyes are bright, he’s feeling fine,  

Vitamin D makes Douglas shine.  

But in the dark, where his cousins play -  

All night long and throughout the day -

On TV, X-Box, iPad, phone, 

The dinos ache and frown and groan. . .”
