Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia with high morbidity risk. Observational studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher atrial fibrillation risk but there is limited evidence whether vitamin D supplementation could affect the risk. In these post hoc analyses from the Finnish Vitamin D Trial, we compared the incidence of atrial fibrillation with 5-year supplementation of vitamin D3 (1600 IU/d or 3200 IU/d) vs placebo.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in adulthood, increasing in prevalence with age and carrying a major burden of morbidity. Therefore, with aging populations, methods to decrease AF risk are needed.

Mechanistic studies suggest a role for vitamin D deficiency in the pathogenesis of AF,1 and in observational studies vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased AF risk.2 However, only a few randomized clinical trials (RCT) have investigated whether vitamin D supplementation could reduce AF risk in general populations. In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), vitamin D3 supplementation of 400 IU/d with calcium 1,000 mg/d for a mean 4.3 years did not have an effect on the AF risk.3 Similarly, in the recent Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL) Rhythm Study, supplementation with 2,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 did not affect the AF risk over 5.3 years.4

The aim of the current analysis was to investigate the effects of 5-year vitamin D3 supplementation with 1,600 IU/d or 3,200 IU/d on AF risk, compared to placebo, among generally healthy men and women in the Finnish Vitamin D Trial (FIND).
