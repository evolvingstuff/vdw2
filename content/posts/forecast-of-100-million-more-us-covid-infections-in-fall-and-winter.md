#### Coronavirus wave this fall could infect 100 million, administration warns

 **[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/05/06/fall-winter-coronavirus-wave/) May 7, 2022** 

* "Those projections assume that omicron and its subvariants will continue to dominate community spread, and there will not be a dramatically different strain of the virus, the official said, acknowledging the pandemic’s course could be altered by many factors."

* "Several experts agreed that a major wave this fall and winter is possible given  **waning immunit** y from vaccines and infections,  **loosened restriction**  and the rise of variants better able to escape immune protections"

 **Govt forecast appears to ignore others on the way or not discovered**
