* This study only considered Vitamin D Levels during pregnancy of slightly above 20 ng

* Tooth mineralization is assumed to happen during pregnancy

* The many benefits of vitamin D during pregnancy typically occur above 40 ng

* It is rare to find a woman living much of her life indoors with no supplementation with even 30 ng of vitamin D

* We anticipate that > 40 ng of Vitamin D during pregnancy will result in good tooth mineralization

* > 40 ng of vitamin D is typical for women living outdoors a lot: 

   * native Africans, gardeners,  life guards

* > 40 ng of vitamin D is also achieved by taking 6,400 IU of Vitamin D during pregnancy 

   * Unfortunately current trials do not start adding vitamin D until the 10 week

   * And those trials do not get > 40 ng until weeks 18-22  (12th week if use loading doses)

   * Tooth development starts at  6 weeks

   * Need good Vitamin D level before mineralization â€“ need to find out when that happens
