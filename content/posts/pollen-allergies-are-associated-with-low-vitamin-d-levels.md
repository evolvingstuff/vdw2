#### Asked [Perplexity AI - Deep Research](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/are-pollen-allergies-associate-a9fPnWgqQxen6jR.wkxsxw): Are pollen allergies associated with low vitamin D?

 **The Association Between Pollen Allergies and Vitamin D: A Comprehensive Analysis** 

Current research provides substantial evidence suggesting a significant association between pollen allergies, particularly allergic rhinitis, and vitamin D status. Studies consistently demonstrate both the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among allergic rhinitis patients and the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation for symptom management.

 **Prevalence of Vitamin D Deficiency in Allergic Rhinitis Patients** 

Multiple studies have found a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among individuals suffering from allergic rhinitis. In a cross-sectional study conducted in Indonesia, researchers discovered that 63% of allergic rhinitis patients had severe vitamin D deficiency [2](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=78439). Similarly, another study found that 62.5% of patients diagnosed with allergic rhinitis were vitamin D deficient [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8163896/). This pattern appears consistent across different populations, suggesting a potential relationship between vitamin D status and allergic responses to pollen and other environmental allergens.

The connection appears particularly strong in pediatric populations. Research has shown that the proportion of severe vitamin D deficiency was significantly higher in children with allergic rhinitis (18.5%) compared to healthy children (10.5%) [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4214003/). This observation raises important questions about the role of vitamin D in the development and progression of allergic diseases during childhood.

 **Correlation Between Vitamin D Levels and Allergic Rhinitis Severity** 

Beyond mere association, evidence suggests that vitamin D levels correlate with the severity of allergic rhinitis symptoms. A study examining this relationship found a significant negative correlation between vitamin D deficiency and severity of allergic rhinitis status (rs = -0.321; p = 0.005) [2](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=78439). This indicates that as vitamin D levels decrease, the severity of allergic rhinitis symptoms tends to increase.

This correlation has been observed in multiple clinical settings. In one investigation, researchers noted that patients with severe vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml) had significantly higher Total Nasal Symptom Scores (TNSS) averaging 11.3, compared to those with moderate deficiency (20-30 ng/ml) who had an average TNSS of 8.6 [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8163896/). The finding that more severe vitamin D deficiency corresponds with more pronounced allergic symptoms provides compelling evidence for a dose-dependent relationship between these factors.

 **Effects of Vitamin D Supplementation on Allergic Rhinitis Symptoms** 

The potential therapeutic value of vitamin D supplementation for allergic rhinitis has been investigated in several clinical trials with promising results. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in children aged 5-12 who were sensitive to grass pollen found that vitamin D supplementation (1000 IU daily) during pollen season significantly reduced symptoms and medication use compared to placebo [1](https://www.archivesofmedicalscience.com/Clinical-and-immunological-effects-of-vitamin-D-supplementation-during-the-pollen,63426,0,2.html).

A 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis examining randomized controlled trials provided further support for these findings. The analysis showed that compared with placebos, vitamin D supplementation without corticosteroids alleviated allergic rhinitis symptoms (Standardized Mean Difference = −0.56, 95% CI: −0.90 to −0.23) [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11857834/). Additionally, combination treatment with corticosteroids also showed symptom improvement, though the effect was not statistically significant [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11857834/).

Another placebo-controlled trial found "highly significant reduction" in the total nasal symptom score after vitamin D supplementation in allergic rhinitis patients [4](https://publications.ersnet.org/content/erj/46/suppl59/pa2559). Furthermore, a study examining the addition of vitamin D to standard treatment with intranasal steroid spray demonstrated statistically significant improvement in post-treatment scores compared to using the spray alone [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8163896/).

 **Immunological Mechanisms Explaining the Relationship** 

The association between vitamin D and allergic rhinitis appears to have biological plausibility through several immunological mechanisms. Vitamin D has known immunomodulatory effects on allergen-induced inflammatory pathways through vitamin D receptors (VDR) expressed on various immune cells, including B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4369152/).

One randomized controlled trial demonstrated specific immunological effects of vitamin D supplementation. The study found an increase in CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (7.06 vs. 10.5%; p = 0.0013) in the vitamin D group compared to controls [1](https://www.archivesofmedicalscience.com/Clinical-and-immunological-effects-of-vitamin-D-supplementation-during-the-pollen,63426,0,2.html). Additionally, a significant correlation between CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cell induction and reduction in exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), a marker of airway inflammation, was observed in the vitamin D group (p = 0.0217) [1](https://www.archivesofmedicalscience.com/Clinical-and-immunological-effects-of-vitamin-D-supplementation-during-the-pollen,63426,0,2.html).

Vitamin D may potentially decrease the severity of allergies through various mechanisms, including effects on immune cells, improved handling or prevention of predisposing infections, decreased inflammatory responses, and enhanced lung function [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4369152/). It has been shown to inhibit both Th1- and Th2-type immune responses, which could be particularly relevant to allergic conditions that are characterized by Th2 dominance [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4369152/).

 **Limitations and Considerations in Current Research** 

Despite the growing evidence supporting an association between vitamin D and allergic rhinitis, some studies suggest limitations in our understanding. A systematic review examining vitamin D supplementation for primary prevention of allergic diseases found that supplementation for pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and infants may not decrease the risk of developing allergic diseases, including allergic rhinitis [9](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/all.13241). This suggests that while vitamin D may help manage existing allergies, its role in preventing their initial development remains uncertain.

Additionally, the effects of vitamin D supplementation may vary based on individual factors. The 2025 meta-analysis noted that the proportion of female participants in randomized controlled trials and concomitant corticosteroid use influenced the vitamin D response [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11857834/), indicating that demographic and treatment variables may modify the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation.

 **Conclusion** 

The current body of evidence strongly suggests an association between pollen allergies (allergic rhinitis) and vitamin D status. Patients with allergic rhinitis frequently demonstrate vitamin D deficiency, with more severe deficiency correlating with more pronounced symptoms. Vitamin D supplementation appears to offer therapeutic benefits for symptom management, likely through its immunomodulatory effects on allergic inflammatory pathways.

While these findings are promising, questions remain regarding the optimal dosing of vitamin D supplementation, its role in primary prevention versus management, and how individual factors might influence treatment outcomes. As our understanding of the relationship between vitamin D and allergic diseases continues to evolve, vitamin D assessment and possible supplementation may become an important component of comprehensive allergic rhinitis management, particularly during pollen seasons.

* Counterintuitively, HEPA filters become even more efficient at capturing particles smaller than 0.3 microns. This means that while 0.3 microns serves as the benchmark testing standard, HEPA filters can actually capture particles as small as 0.01 microns, which includes many viruses and the smallest bacteria.

* MERV 11 filters demonstrate varying efficiency across different particle size ranges:

   * For particles between 0.3-1.0 microns: ≥20% efficiency

   * For particles between 1.0-3.0 microns: ≥65% efficiency

   * For particles between 3.0-10.0 microns: ≥85% efficiency

Most allergenic pollen grains typically fall within the 15-75 micron range, so MERV 11 furnace filters catch all pollen grains
