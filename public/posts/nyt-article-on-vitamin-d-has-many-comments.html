But there is more and more evidence that vitamin D is a critical player in numerous other aspects of metabolism. A new study suggests many Americans aren’t getting anywhere nearly enough of the vitamin, and it may be affecting their heart health.</p><p>In the study, researchers looked at tens of thousands of healthy adults 50 and older whose vitamin D levels had been measured during routine checkups. A majority, they found, were deficient in the vitamin. About two-thirds had less vitamin D in their bloodstreams than the authors considered healthy, and many were extremely deficient.</p><p>Less than two years later, the researchers found, those who had extremely low levels of the vitamin were almost twice as likely to have died or suffered a stroke than those with adequate amounts. They also had more coronary artery disease and were twice as likely to have developed heart failure.</p><p>The findings, which are being presented today at an American Heart Association conference in Orlando, don’t prove that lack of vitamin D causes heart disease; they only suggest a link between the two. But cardiologists are starting to pay increasing attention because of what they’re learning about vitamin D’s roles in regulating blood pressure, inflammation and glucose control — all critical body processes in cardiovascular health.</p><p>Earlier experiments in mice that were genetically altered not to respond to vitamin D found that the animals developed high blood pressure and a heart condition called left ventricular hypertrophy. And population studies of humans found higher rates of coronary heart disease and hypertension the further people live from the equator. Vitamin D deficiency is rare in tropical settings because of the strong sunlight, which promotes creation of the vitamin in the skin.</p><p>“What we were taught in medical school about vitamin D is that it’s associated with rickets and calcium metabolism,” said Dr. Joseph B. Muhlestein, a researcher with Intermountain Medical Center in Murray, Utah, and one of the authors of the new study. “We cardiologists didn’t worry about it; and we certainly didn’t order vitamin D levels.”</p><p>That, however, is changing. “What’s been discovered in the last few years is a significantly greater role for vitamin D,” Dr. Muhlestein said. “There are perhaps 200 different important metabolic processes that use vitamin D as a co-factor.”</p><p>The study involved 27,686 patients at the Intermountain Medical Center based in Salt Lake City. Low tobacco and alcohol use rates in that patient population made it easier for researchers to focus on the effects of vitamin D on heart health.</p><p>Patients were divided into three groups based on their vitamin D levels: “normal,” for those who had over 30 nanograms per milliliter of blood, “low” for those with levels of 15 to 30, and “very low” for those with levels less than 15.</p><p>Those with the lowest vitamin D levels were 77 percent more likely to die during the follow-up, 78 percent more likely to have a stroke and 45 percent more likely to develop coronary artery disease than those with normal levels. They were twice as likely to develop heart failure as those with normal levels. And even those who had moderate deficiencies were at higher risk, the researchers said.</p><p>People who were vitamin D deficient were also twice as likely to have diabetes and tended to have more high blood pressure. But being vitamin D deficient was an independent risk factor for poor outcomes, regardless of other risk factors like diabetes, Dr. Muhlestein said.</p><p>The next step for researchers is to figure out whether vitamin D deficiency actually causes disease. It’s possible that people who already have an underlying illness spend more time indoors and aren’t exposed to the sun, where they can absorb vitamin D through the skin. It’s also possible that disease processes already under way may affect vitamin D levels.</p><p>A clinical trial that randomly assigns participants to take vitamin D supplements or a placebo might be the next step, Dr. Muhlestein said. Researchers at Harvard and Brigham and Women’s Hospital are starting a large trial in January that will test the effects of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplements on men and women in their 60s.</p><p>Dr. Thomas Wang, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard who published an earlier trial on vitamin D deficiency and heart disease, said that whether treating vitamin D deficiency will have a beneficial effect on heart health is still an open question.</p><p>“If that does turn out to be the case, it would have pretty profound public health implications,” he said. “Vitamin D deficiency is very common in this country and other developed countries in northern latitudes, where people don’t get much sunlight and spend most of their time indoors.”</p><p>Doctors warn that anyone concerned about vitamin D levels should check with a doctor and have blood tests run. Vitamin D supplements are inexpensive and sold over the counter, but excessive amounts of vitamin D can be toxic.</p><p>The Institute of Medicine recommends adults under 50 who aren’t getting vitamin D from the sun get 200 international units of vitamin D a day, and that those 50 to 70 get 400 I.U. a day. Elderly people need even more. There is some controversy, however, over optimal amounts. Many doctors are advising their patients to take much higher amounts, such as 1,000 I.U. a day. The American Academy of Pediatrics has already increased its recommendation for supplementing breastfeeding infants to 400 I.U. — vitamin D is one nutrient breast milk doesn’t provide enough of — and the Institute of Medicine will issue updated recommendations in May 2010.</p><p>Comments</p><ol><li>Earlier comments on this Well blog indicated that vitamin D also protects against neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, MS, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s. It truly is the “wonder vitamin.”</li></ol><p>Question: is there any danger of getting too MUCH vitamin D? Is it a fat-soluble or water-soluble vitamin? There is a risk, for example, of getting too much vitamin A or calcium.</p><ol start=4><li><pre><code>   Canada has much higher recommendations for Vit D intake. See http://www.cps.ca/ENGLISH/statements/II/VitaminD.pdf for example. Pediatricians in Vancouver, just over the border, suggest 2000IU for children.   I”m an apparently healthy 55 y.o. male in Seattle and need to take 6000 IU/day to get my blood level into the 40’s on the blood test (still low-ish).
</code></pre></li><li><p>People with dark skin living in the northern latitudes(like myself) need to pay particular attention to studies like this. From what I’ve read, living where we do, we would need to spend two hours, totally nude, in full sun in order to get enough vitamin D each day. Between this and the fact that so many of us can’t drink milk, we’ve gotta get on top of those vitamin D supplements.</p></li><li><p>Herring anyone?</p></li></ol><p>As posters mentioned in the earlier Well “Phys Ed:” discussion, historical northern peoples all ate high fat diets from fish, fowl, and/or mammals, and survived sun-free (and anecdotally, type 2 diabetes and heart disease free) through those long dark winters.</p><p>If appropriate interventional studies are designed and implemented, I expect it will likely become clear that both sun avoidance and animal fat avoidance are bad ideas for most humans, consistent with our evolutionary history. I’m convinced vitamin D is very important, but it will also be interesting to tease out how much of the associations this study finds are because of the vitamin D vs. the other effects of sun exposure and diet on the human organism.</p><ol start=8><li>There has also been research linking low vitamin D levels with an increased risk of breast cancer. Amazing how one vitamin can effect so many different systems isn’t it.</li></ol><p>Kate @ <a href=http://www.aftercancernowwhat.com>http://www.aftercancernowwhat.com</a></p><ol start=15><li>The current article is a great example of how things should be done. Document a correlation between heart disease and low vitamin D levels, but then follow it up by an intervention study asking whether taking vitamin D pills can prevent heart disease.</li></ol><p>Correlations are simply not enough. Remember what happened with hormone replacement therapy(HRT) and breast cancer. Correlation studies showed that HRT was associated with less breast cancer, but when subjects took HRT, it actually caused breast cancer when compared to a placebo.</p><ol start=18><li>Many of these studies document associations rather than causations, or reflect results in laboratory preparations. There’s little, if any, harm to checking levels, and taking supplements carefully, ideally in the context of a good diet rather than substituting for one. The various reports are fascinating and well worth researching further. But the notion of a ‘wonder vitamin’ with key roles in every metabolic and pathological process from cancer to influenza to cardiovascular disease to Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, and the implication that a disease-free Utopia awaits its full exploitation, leaves me just a bit skeptical.</li></ol><p>Calcium, which vitamin D has been long known to have a crucial role in, does indeed show up in various places. Calcium channels in heart tissue have long been a pharmacological target, for instance, in treating arrhythmias.</p><p>Vitamin D is indeed a fat soluble vitamin, so excessive ingestion of supplements can lead to toxicity.Less may well be not enough, but more after a certain point is too much.</p><ol start=19><li><pre><code> …..

I hope everyone pays attention and also helps their parents pay attention to these crucial matters - for heart issues as well as osteoporosis issues.</p><h1 id=heading></h1><p>This article is an example of irresponsible science journalism.</p><p>The study reported is a weak study, rife with opportunity for confounding, and does not in any way prove causation. In fact, all of the evidence regarding vitamin D is weak and requires further research before any recommendations to be made. The authors clearly have a stake in promoting their own study, and their wild overstatements about the study’s importance and quality should have been questioned with better depth.</p><p>The recommendation in the study for people to see their doctors and have blood testing done is premature. It is still not known that vitamin D “deficiency” is a cause of any single illness, and also not known whether vitamin D supplementation does any good (aside from improving the metabolism of calcium, which has long been known).</p><p>There is a cyclical nature to the American vitamin obsession. Every few years, one vitamin becomes the vitamin-du-jour, is touted as the cure-all for every disease under the sun, and then when truly, rigorous scientific studies are carried out, the discovery is made that in fact supplementation of the vitamin in healthy people makes no difference (eg. vitamin C), or in some cases, does harm (eg. vitamin A).</p><p>There is no magic pill.

The health benefits of vitamin D can not be overemphasized as the vitamin is so important to a number of life processes and disease prevention. Not only is vitamin D necessary for strong bones, but it deficiency of the vitamin has been linked to rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and type I diabetes. Few people may know this but vitamin D also plays a role in mood and appetite. In October 2008 I wrote an article “Are Your Children Getting Enough Vitamin D?” wherein I discussed the role that vitamin D plays in maintenance of optimum health. You can find the article here:</li></ol><p>Fish oil contains essential fatty acids (EFAs) which play a role in reducing cardiovascular disease by improving circulation; it even boosts the body’s immune system. People tend to not consume enough fish which means that are deficient in omega 3 fatty acid which is found in fish such as mackerel, salmon and herring. If people added fish to their diet or took fish oil supplements it could go a long way toward improving health. You can read about the role of EFAs and their sources at my website.</p><p>I’m also looking forward to the results of the upcoming Harvard and Brigham and Women’s Hospital study on the relationship between EFAs and vitamin D as I would not surprise me to read that the researchers observe an added benefit of these nutrients working together improve the cardiovascular health of the test subjects.</p><ol start=33><li>Vitamin D deficiency is fat-soluble and correlated with obesity, making the causal connection between heart disease and diabetes with Vitamin D tricky. As others have pointed out, correlation does not equal causation and intervention trials need to be done.</li></ol><p>I also find it odd that there is a vast wave of Vitamin D “deficiencies”. There is some disagreement on how much is enough, without a rigorous breakdown on what exactly the cutoffs mean. Given that we do not have a wave of rickets, we do not know if the current values are really any different from what has been seen in the past.</p><p>Given the potential for toxicity, these issues need to be addressed in a serious way before the majority of the American populace ends up on supplements. Past studies (liked the beta-carotene or Vitamin E/selenium studies)have shown that vitamins are not always as beneficial as they are touted to be and should not be universally recommended without the research to support it.</p><ol start=34><li><p>One has to be careful in interpreting what the AAP said about human milk and vitamin D. The statement did not say that human milk is deficient in vitamin D per se; rather, it states that if a breastfeeding woman is deficient in vitamin D her milk will be deficient in vitamin D and unless her infant receives either a supplement or sunlight exposure (which can be detrimental to the skin), the recipient infant will be deficient in vitamin D. In women who are replete in vitamin D, they have great levels in their milk. It makes no sense at all to think that we evolved if the majority of our species as we moved away from the equator was deficient in a major vitamin or in this case, hormone. The phenomenon is recent on the evolutionary scale. No one should be deficient in this vitamin/hormone and there are steps that can be implemented to correct the deficiency–in both mother and baby.</p></li><li><p>Association studies do not prove causation. Indiscriminate use of high-dose Vitamin D supplementation is imprudent and may be harmful. As others have pointed out, rigorous clinical trials are required to determine the risk/benefit ratio of Vitamin D supplementation. As prior studies have shown, for example, there is no benefit for routine supplementation of Vitamin C or Vitamin E. In fact, these may even be harmful. Prior studies of Vitamin D such as the Women’s Health Initiative showed no benefit from Vitamin D supplementation.</p></li></ol><p>Clinical trials are vital in order to better understand the risks and benefits of Vitamin D supplementation.

Nothing else comes close. The benefits are just being discovered and we have a long, long way to go. I am an amateur researcher of supplements and vitamins for 13 years. I have read thousands of studies and abstracts on practically everything. Last year I stopped looking at anything but vitamin D. It is absolutely the most misunderstood molecule on the planet. NOTHING is more important than raising and maintaining (for the rest of your life) a level of activated vitamin D (chloecalciferol) of at least 50 ng/ml. The FDA, NIH, AMA know almost nothing about this compound and fortunately there are researchers who have 40+ years of knowledge to share. I stress again it is absolutely the most important thing you will ever do. Vitamin D, a steroid, not a vitamin is the body’s most important disease fighter. It is incomparable to anything else man made combined. Get the facts at: The Vitamin D Council. And read everything you can find. Heart disease is almost completely a function of vitamin D deficiency over decades. As is cancer, diabetes, etc etc etc. Nothing matters in the end but 50 ng/ml.</p><p>— Charles S</p><ol start=73><li>In the last year, I have included summaries of the following Vitamin D into my newsletter:</li></ol><p>Low 25-Hydroxyvitamin-D Levels Associated With Higher Prevalence of Peripheral Artery Disease</p><p>Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2008;28</p><p><a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/573388?src=mpnews&amp;spon=2&amp;uac=22879SK">==http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/573388?src=mpnews&amp;spon=2&amp;uac=22879SK==</a></p><p>Guidelines Needed for Optimal Vitamin D Supplementation in Cancer Patients</p><p>A growing amount of research suggests that vitamin D may be beneficial to cancer patients.

You made an erroneous statement that past(?) studies showed that there was less risk of breast cancer with HRT. What a bogus comment! Many retrospective and prospective studies showed an association with HRT and an increased risk of breast cancer. The red flags were there, but many women and health professionals bought into the propaganda of the pharmaceutical companies and their massive ad campaign.
