### VitaminDWiki

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Mongolia's Program could have done 1 or more of the following</span>** 

1.  **Quickly give vitamin D levels when symptoms appear**  - greatly reducing the number of hospital cases

   * Note:  **This is what VitaminDWiki is doing**  [Reduce COVID-19 risks with 50,000 IU Vitamin D doses](/posts/reduce-covid-19-risks-with-50000-iu-vitamin-d-doses)

   * Note:  **You can do the same thing** 

1. Have given vitamin D to those who enter the hospital - but this would not account for the low hosptialization rate

1. Increased Vitamin D levels of the entire population - the most expensive solution

   * Hope to find out which soon which solutions they have taken

 **Maongolia had perhaps the lowest Vitamin D levels in the world** 

* [Mongolian women have the lowest levels of vitamin D in the world – Sept 2013](/posts/mongolian-women-have-the-lowest-levels-of-vitamin-d-in-the-world)

* [Percent of population with less than 20 ng of vitamin D](/posts/percent-of-population-with-less-than-20-ng-of-vitamin-d)  98% in Mongolia < 20 ng

* An Ipad containing 11,000 pages in VitaminDWiki was shown at the meeting - in Mongolian (1 of >100 languages)

#### [Dr. Leslie Ray Matthews (Facebook post)](https://www.facebook.com/lrmatthews1/posts/10222296880563363)

“Mongolia's National Vitamin D3 Program Successful: As of February 27, 2021, Mongolia has had only two (2) coronavirus deaths. Mongolia is located between Russia to the north and China to the south. Mongolia has a population of 3.1 million people. Mississippi has a population of 3 million. Mongolia has a per capita income of $400 per month. Mississippi has a per capita income of $2,030 per month. 

 **Eighty-seven per cent (87%) of Mongolia's population was vitamin D3 deficient in April 2019,**  when we visited the highly disciplined country. Mongolia started an aggressive "National Vitamin D3 Program" to educate and treat its citizens. Mongolia has had two (2) deaths from the coronavirus. Mississippi has had many 6,669 deaths from the coronavirus. The second (2nd) photo below shows me being interviewed on Mongolian National TV and addressing Mongolia's politicians and medical community. The third (3rd) photo below shows us visiting a medical clinic and interacting with young Mongolian doctors. Vitamin D3 is God's miracle vitamin!”
