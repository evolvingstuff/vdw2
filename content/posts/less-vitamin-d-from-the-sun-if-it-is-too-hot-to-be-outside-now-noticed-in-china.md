#### Correlation between meteorological factors and vitamin D status under different season

Sci Rep . 2023 Mar 23;13(1):4762. [doi: 10.1038/s41598-023-31698-2.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31698-2.)

Pregnant women with low vitamin D levels tend to have poor clinical outcomes. Meteorological factors were associated with vitamin D. Here, we aimed to study the current status of 25-Hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in pregnant women in Kunshan city and investigate the meteorological factors associated with 25(OH)D levels under different seasons. The correlation between meteorological factors and 25(OH)D levels was estimated by cross-correlation analysis and multivariate logistic regression. A restrictive cubic spline method was used to estimate the non-linear relationship. From 2015 to 2020, a total of 22,090 pregnant women were enrolled in this study. Pregnant women with 25(OH)D concentrations below 50 nmol/l represent 65.85% of the total study population. There is a positive correlation between temperature and 25(OH)D. And there is a protective effect of the higher temperature on vitamin D deficiency. However, in the subgroup analysis, we found that in autumn, high temperatures above 30 °C may lead to a decrease in 25(OH)D levels. This study shows that vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women may widespread in eastern China. There is a potential inverted U-shaped relationship between temperature and 25(OH)D levels, which has implications for understanding of vitamin D changes under different seasons.

Pregnant women with low vitamin D levels tend to have poor clinical outcomes. Meteorological factors were associated with vitamin D. Here, we aimed to study the current status of 25-Hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in pregnant women in Kunshan city and investigate the meteorological factors associated with 25(OH)D levels under different seasons. The correlation between meteorological factors and 25(OH)D levels was estimated by cross-correlation analysis and multivariate logistic regression. A restrictive cubic spline method was used to estimate the non-linear relationship. From 2015 to 2020, a total of 22,090 pregnant women were enrolled in this study. Pregnant women with 25(OH)D concentrations below 50 nmol/l represent 65.85% of the total study population. There is a positive correlation between temperature and 25(OH)D. And there is a protective effect of the higher temperature on vitamin D deficiency. However, in the subgroup analysis, we found that in autumn, high temperatures above 30 °C may lead to a decrease in 25(OH)D levels. This study shows that vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women may widespread in eastern China. There is a potential inverted U-shaped relationship between temperature and 25(OH)D levels, which has implications for understanding of vitamin D changes under different seasons.
