Many drugs have drugs have serious, major interactions

More tests are available now (MRI, CAT scan, etc) which, while expensive, should be able to eliminate other possibilities (how many time are they use for confirmation vs elimination?)

Doctors have less time for appointments – so cannot get into the patient history, concerns, – upstream issues

Less time – due to say payment for a 10 mnute appointment as a 25 minute appointment

Changed landscape

Less D in people now

In hospital setting ( and many more doctors are associated with hospitals) the benefit to the hospital of the doctor is in # of tests and # surgeries and # of hospital stays

Phase 2 – Dr. Watcon asks Dr. for more information

Phase 3 – Dr. Watson interacts with the patient via a voice interface – perhaps from home, via smartphone.  Dr. watson has photograph memory of all previous health conditions of the person and perhaps near relatives, co-workers, members of the household, classmates, 

Dr. Topol

Dr. less willing now to try new things for which there is not a consensus.  Not enough time to investigate, liability concerns, 

Shorter but more appointments

Are doctors paid more if they take several visits to get the right answer?
