More than four million Americans present to the emergency department (ED) each year for evaluation after MVC. More than 90% of these individuals are discharged to home; evidence suggests that chronic musculoskeletal pain is common in this population and that rates of chronic pain development are increased in African Americans (AAs). Biological mechanisms responsible for elevated risk in AAs remain poorly understood. Vitamin D deficiency (VDD, defined as 25<span>[OH]</span>D plasma levels <30 ng/mL) is known to be more prevalent among Aas.
