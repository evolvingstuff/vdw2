* "I actually can’t think of anything that is exceptionally important and extremely rare yet at the same time incredibly inexpensive.  That is, anything except Vitamin D. "

* " Vitamin D supplementation is not only easy, it is also the most affordable."

* "Sadly, a low Vitamin D level is just the latest factor associated with our society’s ever-deteriorating health.  

> The only silver-lining to that cloud is that correcting a low Vitamin D level is cheap and easy to do. "

* "I recommend above 50 ng/ml (nanograms per milliliter) and ideally between 60 ng/ml and 80 ng/ml. "
