 **Based on food consumption and mandated food fortification** 

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source of Vitamin D | Error type | Details |
| Milk |  **underestimate**  | Low fat and non-fat is much less bio-available |
| Animal meat and products | underestimate | animals raised outdoors in some countries |
| Fish  | underestimate | ignores fatty fish consumption |
| Fortification - optional  | underestimate | ignored |
| Fortified edible oils | underestimate | not considered |
| Sunshine | underestimate | not considered |
| Supplements | underestimate | not considered |
| -  | -  |  |
| Fish |  **overestimate**  | less Vitamin D from farmed fish |
| Fortification | overestimate   | ignores that D2 is not as good as D3 |
