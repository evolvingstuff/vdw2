   * "In the small study of 204 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Hubei province of China, researchers noted that nearly  **49%**  of these patients presented to the emergency department with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain."

   * " **About half**  of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have digestive symptoms, according to new research on 206 patients with mild disease, released online March 30 in the American Journal of Gastroenterology. In addition, 53% of the study patients with COVID-19 had a positive coronavirus stool test, raising questions about different ways the virus could be transmitted, other than by respiratory droplets, to other people."

   * "But what we've been learning, in the meantime, is that many of those patients who come to the hospital –  **in fact over half**  – have a digestive complaint at the same time as their respiratory complaints. And in many cases, they started with GI symptoms first, before they ever developed a cough or shortness of breath.""

   * "Gastric symptoms from COVID-19 are likely underreported in the U.S. "There's a potentially large group of people who never really seek care," Spiegel says. "They're out in the community with diarrhea and possible fever in three-quarters of the cases, and haven't even been diagnosed with COVID or can't get tested for COVID because they don't have a cough or shortness of breath." Without respiratory symptoms, he says, people don't meet testing criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

   * Review of a Standord sudy: "Gastrointestinal symptoms were reported by  **31.9%**  of the patients. The majority of that group described the symptoms as mild. Twenty-two percent said they experienced loss of appetite, 22% had nausea and vomiting, and 12% had diarrhea, the study said.

   * "“No patients had gastrointestinal symptoms prior to the development of respiratory symptoms or as their only manifestation of COVID-19.”

   * "When they presented to a hospital, 103 of the 204 people — or  **50.5%**  — were experiencing digestive symptoms. The main digestive symptoms among the study cohort were a lack of appetite, in 81 individuals, and diarrhea, in 35."

   * "In the new study, the research team tracked data from 206 patients with mild COVID-19. Nearly  **one-quarter**  (48) had digestive symptoms only, 69 displayed both digestive and respiratory symptoms, and 89 had respiratory symptoms only."
